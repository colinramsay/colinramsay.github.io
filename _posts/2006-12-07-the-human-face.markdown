<p><a href="http://shopify.com/">Shopify</a> seems to be doing pretty well at the moment, and deservedly so. It's nice to see <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Pixelsoup/~3/57901501/quote">the human face</a> behind upcoming companies like <a href="http://www.jadedpixel.com/">jaded Pixel</a> though. I really think that Shopify is the only sensible choice for people implementing budget e-commerce systems, it is affordable and simple.</p>
