<p>Copied from H&L because I think it's good....</p>
<p>I was scared the whole week, it was hard to believe that something like this could happen. I've been keeping quiet until now, but fuck you NME, fuck you for missing out on the story of the year, the album of the year, the band of the decade. Fuck you for not realising that even though you've disappeared up your own arse you still can't see the sun - it's because it's shining on us. The light is gonna shine. And you've missed it, because you're miserable, cynical motherfuckers.</p>
<p>Fuck you.</p>
