<p>I bought one of <a href="http://www.ebuyer.com/customer/products/index.html?action=c2hvd19wcm9kdWN0X292ZXJ2aWV3&product_uid=62687">these fellas</a> a while back, and it was soon good that my friend <a href="http://www.lairdy.co.uk/">Lairdy</a> bought one after just glancing at it. But <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/AWholeLottaNothing?m=465">this Dell monitor</a> looks like a step above, and huge with it. If you can't stretch to that, I'd fully recommend the <a href="http://www.ebuyer.com/customer/products/index.html?action=c2hvd19wcm9kdWN0X292ZXJ2aWV3&product_uid=62687">Sharp LL191AB</a>.</p>
