<p>Today I managed to actually make Ruby on Rails do stuff. It was reasonably straightforward; it's very easy to say that I could do it faster in ASP.NET, and I probably could. That would be missing the point, because this is a learning process. I expect to pick up speed from now on, though tmrw may be a bit tricky... anyway, <a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/static/ror/Day%203.html" title="Ruby on Rails - Day Three">here's day three of the diary</a>.</p>
