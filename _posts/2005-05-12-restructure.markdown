<p>I anticipate a problem with this site very soon - I'm moving house and it's hosted on my home connection. I want as little downtime as possible, but since it's inevitable I think I'll do something constructive while I'm offline. I've got a Textdrive account. It supports Movable Type. I see a plan in the offing. Meanwhile I need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expand my Projects section</li>
<li>Create an articles section
<li>
<li>Make the homepage something other than a splash page</li>
<li>Post more stories like <a href="http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_1389702.html?menu=news.quirkies">this</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Coming soon to a little-known blog near you.</p>
