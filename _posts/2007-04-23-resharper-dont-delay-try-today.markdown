<p><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/">Jetbrains</a> have announced that <a href="http://blogs.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2007/04/resharper-252-released-uses-no-license-evaluation-model/">Resharper is moving to a new evaluation model</a> which will make it easier to try out their <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">outstanding Visual Studio extension</a>. Previously, if you wanted to test Resharper you'd have to download it then request an evaluation license. But now you can simply <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/download/index.html">download</a>, install, and enjoy 30 days of developing pleasure.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">Resharper includes</a> improved Intellisense, refactoring options, better error highlighting, reformatting options, code generation, and lots more features guaranteed to put a smile on the face of any developer. If you've never tried it, I urge you to get along to the Jetbrains site and <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/download/index.html">download Resharper</a>.</p>
