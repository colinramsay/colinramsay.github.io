<p>There's been a <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/AWholeLottaNothing?m=667">bit of talk recently</a> (and <a href="http://www.peterme.com/archives/000411.html">not so recently</a>) about <a href="http://www.powazek.com/2005/09/000540.html">using the footer of a page for something more</a> than credits or terms and conditions. </p>
<p>This does make sense; if people are going to be scrolling <em>anyway</em> then give them a bit of a reward for it. The danger comes if you put crucial information at the bottom of the page and your users miss it. It's a fine line, and I think that's why this method is rarely used.</p>
