<p>Still alive, barely. Been sick over the weekend and I'm concentrating on getting stuff done. Multimedia Project Management is not a friend of mine, I can tell thee.</p>
<p>Things of interest? Firebird is getting a new download manager and add bookmark dialogue - probably the only interesting things to happen in it's development for a while.</p>
<p>Embrace play Leeds Cockpit on the 19th, 20th and 21st of December. Long awaited gigs, 200 tickets a night and I've got one. Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Night night.</p>
