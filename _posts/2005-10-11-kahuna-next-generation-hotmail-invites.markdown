<p>If you fancy having a go at the new version of Hotmail, just visit the <a href="http://test.msn.ignia.com/minisites/hotmail/default.aspx?locale=en-us">beta sign-up page</a> and enter an active Hotmail address... Let me know how it goes, I'm interested in their CSS layout (I've heard they're using one) and what next-gen web stuff they're doing.</p>
