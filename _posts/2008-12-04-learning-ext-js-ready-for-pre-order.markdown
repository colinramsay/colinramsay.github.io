<p>A few months ago I was approached by <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/">Packt Publishing</a> to help out with one of their up and coming publications. After reading some of my blog posts and seeing some screencasts I'd done on Ext JS, they felt I'd be a good candidate to co-author a book on the subject. I quizzed them quite a bit before committing; the offer was so out of the blue that I felt I needed as much information as possible, but it's flattering to be offered such an opportunity anyway. When I felt I could make an informed choice, I accepted, and became part of the <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/learning-ext-js/book">Learning Ext JS</a> team.</p>
<p>The other authors are <a href="http://www.vinylfox.com/learning-extjs-book-due-mid-december/">Shea Frederick</a> and <a href="http://blog.cutterscrossing.com/index.cfm/2008/11/11/Upcoming-Book-Learning-ExtJS">Steve "Cutter" Blades</a>. Shea did the first block of chapters:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Getting Started</strong><br />
Setup Ext JS to be used on your page and troubleshoot common installation problems.</li>
<li><strong>The Staples of Ext</strong><br />
Explore some of the foundational components and configuration of Ext JS.</li>
<li><strong>Forms</strong><br />
Create complex forms, database-driven combo boxes, and populate form fields with data.</li>
<li><strong>Buttons, Menus, and Toolbars</strong><br />
Use toolbars to create compact complex navigation for your web application.</li>
<li><strong>Gridsâ??Making Data Intuitive</strong><br />
Render database-driven grids that include paging, complex rendering, and user interaction.</li>
<li><strong>Editor Grid</strong><br />
Go past the standard grid, and set up an editor grid that edits data in line.</li>
<li><strong>In an AJAX World, You Need a Good Layout</strong><br />
Create a layout that provides a very flexible and attractive user interface.</li>
</ol>
<p>I did the middle lot:</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>Ext JS Does Grow on Trees</strong><br />
Demonstrating how to display and manipulate hierarchical data.</li>
<li><strong>Windows and Dialogs</strong><br />
Focusing on displaying information in pop-up containers.</li>
<li><strong>Effects</strong><br />
Add spice to your applications with compelling visual effects.</li>
<li><strong>Drag and Drop</strong><br />
Learn how to move and rearrange elements within your application.</li>
</ol>
<p>Steve rounded it all off with the final chapters:</p>
<ol start="12">
<li><strong>Itâ??s All About the Data</strong><br />
An introduction into the various types of data Stores, the kinds of data they can consume, how that data is defined, and how to get it.</li>
<li><strong>Code for Reuse: Extending Ext JS</strong><br />
An introduction to creating custom application components by extending existing components of the framework.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Ext JS: What Else Can You Do?</strong><br />
A look at many of the utility classes of the library, including formatting and state management, as well as Community Components and resources.</li>
</ol>
<p>It was certainly a learning experience. I thought I knew Ext JS pretty well before this, but having to fill 20 pages of text about a single part of the framework lead me to discover a lot of new things, not least how to fill out text to make it interesting, rather than a lecture. I'd like to thank the Packt team, my co-authors, and of course the Ext JS team for the opportunity - one I never dreamed I'd have.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/learning-ext-js/book">Learning Ext JS is available for pre-order </a> on the Packt Publishing web site, as well as some mainstream retail sites such as <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1847195148/">Amazon</a>. If you do decide to purchase - and I strongly urge you to! - then please let us know what you think by leaving a review on the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1847195148/">Learning Ext JS Amazon page</a>.</p>
