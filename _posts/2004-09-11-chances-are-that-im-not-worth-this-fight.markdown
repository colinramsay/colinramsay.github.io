<p>I feel very limited and <a href="#">boxed</a> in at the moment. People are frustrating and annoying me. "Do you know sometimes when you feel a heaviness in your heart, and you know exactly what's causing it, but you can't do anything about it?". I said that about a week ago, and she nodded, and the heaviness has got worse ever since. It's like I'm being dragged down, slowly, day by day. </p>
<p>As a counterpoint, I probably feel better with myself that I have done for a while. The problems stem from how I deal with others. At the same time, there are those around me - those who carry radience and light like it is their own. For them things seem effortless, even though they are not. From them I take strength, hope, confidence.</p>
<p>There are lights; bright shining lights at the end. I just need to get there.</p>
