<p><a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/05/time-waits-for-no-one.html">Google have released a new tool</a> - <a href="http://webaccelerator.google.com/">Webaccelerator</a>. Working with IE and Firefox, I assume that it just pre-fetches links in an intelligent manner, I've got it installed at will report back. Stuff like this has been around for a while, and it's hard to see why Google's attempt will be better. One hook though - they've got a meter that shows how much time you've save thanks to downloads their utility has made. People like knowing, in real terms, that things they install are working for them in a practical way.</p>
