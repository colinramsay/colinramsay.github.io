<p><a href="http://www.slashdot.org">/.</a> is running a story titled "Life After Netscape For Mozilla Developers". It's liked to story on <a href="www.mozillazine.org">Mozillazine</a>, so their servers will be knackered.</p>
<p>I think it will be interesting to see what the Slashbots make of this diversification of the Mozilla brand - there's already been some comments on XUL, so it's worth a look.</p>
