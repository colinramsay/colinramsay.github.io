<p>Anil Dash tells salespeople <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/AnilDash?m=244">"Don't be a bad pitcher!"</a>.</p>
<p>The "don't talk like a database" point is very relevant. I know that I can pick a pitch I'm not going to be interested in just by the introduction - if it sounds too "off the shelf" I switch off.</p>
