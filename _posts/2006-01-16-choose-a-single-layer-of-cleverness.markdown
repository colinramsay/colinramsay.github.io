<p>This is one of my favourite blog posts of all time: <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000516.html">Choose a single layer of cleverness by David Heinemeier Hansson</a>. It might not even be the <em>right</em> point of view, but the clarity of thought and ability to see it through makes this attitude refreshing.</p>
<p>In a world where we are plagued by design-by-commitee pain, the success of Ruby on Rails and Firefox (who also employed this sort of "benevolent dictator" attitude) should be drawing a lot of worried glances from bad project managers.</p>
