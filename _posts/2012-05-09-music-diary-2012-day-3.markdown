<p><strong>Michael Kiwanuka - Home Again</strong> (<a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/colinramsay/playlist/6gzeZl9UEiR3RAvh6Q7qUd">spotify link</a>)</p>
<p>I only got hold of this album a short while ago, and I really like it. Since then I've heard quite a few people playing it so I wonder if it's going to become popular soon. Anyway, it's easy on the ears and very well put together. I've heard comparisons to Sam Cooke.</p>
<p>The Chapman Family - No More Tears (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ISud-0Ynf4">youtube</a>)</p>
<p>Quick listen.</p>
<p>Errors - Have Some Faith In Magic (<a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/colinramsay/playlist/6hb9TpJRjhmwccwtZVR3fz">spotify link</a>)</p>
<p>Ultimately pretty dull</p>
<p>Noah And The Whale - The First Days Of Spring (<a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/1nMDS9TNOF49irljI2gc5p">spotify link</a>)</p>
<p>I can take or leave this band but this album is very stately and beautiful at times.</p>
<p>Field Music - Plumb</p>
<p>First listen...</p>
<p>Willis Earl Beal - Acousmatic Sorcery (<a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/colinramsay/playlist/2brvvOBEAqyci8xuAe0gYj">spotify link</a>)</p>
<p>This is "raw", which means that music critics will probably love it. I'm undecided as to whether it's actually any good but at least it's different.</p>
