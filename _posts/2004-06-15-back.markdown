<p>Ok, so I discovered why the server kept going down. The power supply was knackered. It finally died one fateful night about two weeks ago, and I assumed it was the motherboard (CPU fan spinning but no beeping). In fact it was some aspect of the PSU, so I've just swapped it out and all is well.</p>
<p>Time for some action round here I think.</p>
