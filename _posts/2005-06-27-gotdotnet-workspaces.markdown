<p>Gotdotnet Workspaces appear to be a sort of Sourceforge for .NET. I just found a post about <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/andresv/archive/2005/06/27/415974.aspx">Retina.NET</a> so I thought I'd check it out.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there's no real detail on the homepage, there's not quick FAQ or About section, and the <em>fucking</em> documentation section asks you to login!</p>
<p>Great stuff chaps. I'm sure your product is very clever, but if it's this hard to find out about and you're that poor at presenting it, I'm not interested.</p>
