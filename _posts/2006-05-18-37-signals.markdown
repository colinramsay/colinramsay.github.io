<p>The single most important thing which 37 Signals are doing is showing that <i>marketing is nonsense</i>. Marketing is easy. Advertising is easy. Make a good product and word of mouth will support your sales.. and a good product is not necessarily something that everyone's heard of. Remember that there are likely to be people doing the same stuff as your, but there is <i>plenty of room</i>. Marketing execs are bad. Advertising is bad.</p>
