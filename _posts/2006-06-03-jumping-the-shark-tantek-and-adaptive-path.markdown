<p>Adaptive Path started to fizzle out after their essay on AJAX - not that they ever really did anything of substance anyway. The loss of Veen seems to have been important, and with a recent post you can see that <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/blog/2006/05/21/integrating-innovation-into-organizations/">they've become removed from the reality of their profession</a>:</p>
<p>"Systemitize innovation processes"</p>
<p><a href="http://tantek.com/log/2006/05.html#d31t0731">Tantek recently posted about something he was undertaking</a> and implicitly compared it with the work done by Tim Berners-Lee when creating the first web server and browser. And then it is revealed that <a href="http://tantek.com/log/2006/05.html#d31t1802">Tantek's work has been to do with Microformats</a>. I've never heard anyone rave about Microformats really. I understand that they encourage interoperability, but they're not cool - they don't capture the imagination at all. Trying to mould hCard into something cool when it's really just an XML schema... come on, you can give it a snazzy name but it's just dull.</p>
<p>Adaptive Path don't matter because they're abstracting themselves into essays, and Microformats don't matter because... well, come on, <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard">read this and tell me that anyone is going to care</a>.</p>
