<p>Ha, I've just noticed that I've got "excellent" karma over at <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a>. I'm not arsed about the "my karma is bigger than yours" subculture, but it does mean that everything I post will start off with a score of 2 - probably bypassing a large portion of people's score filters.</p>
<p>That also means that I have a bigger chance of getting comments noticed and rated to 5. And that means that anything I put in my sig is going to get a traffic boost because it's got high-visibility on one of the largest tech sites on the Internet.</p>
<p>In other words, I have a good advertising route :)</p>
