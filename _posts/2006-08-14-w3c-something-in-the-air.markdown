<p>Something is happening. URLs as timeline:</p>

<p>And of course years of posts and emails and discussion leading up to this. What will change? I think that the web at large has been less and less interested in what the W3C has to say over the past few years - they are an abstract body who operate at a level so high that their heads are now above the clouds.</p>
<p>Of course what is needed is unified, positive action. The Firefox explosion was the last time that happened, and look what we did, look how things changed.</p>
<p>This can happen again. Something is clearly broken, even if it is just the lines of communication.</p>
