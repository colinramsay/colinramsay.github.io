  content: ! "Great!\r\n\r\nYour screencasts are really interesting. I'm a beginner
    in ASP .net 2.0 and I would like to implement MVC pattern. It seems that Monorail
    is a good solution.\r\n\r\nBut I want to use XMLDataSource and control servers
    like Gridview, DetailsView. Do you think it is easy to implement  ?. What are
    the main difficulties ?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  content: ! "You can use the WebForms view engine in Monorail, which would allow
    you to use all of the server controls which you currently use:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.castleproject.org/monorail/documentation/v1rc2/viewengines/webforms/index.html\r\n\r\nPersonally
    I would advise against it, and some of the reasons why can be found in the above
    document. Monorail supports viewcomponents, which are simple, resusable components
    which can be used in your views. For example, the Castle Contrib project contains
    a SmartGrid component which could be used to replace the GridView. I've never
    used either, so I'm maybe not the best person to advise.\r\n\r\nThe Castle Users
    list is a good place to ask advise on moving from WebForms to Monorail:\r\n\r\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/castle-project-users"

<p>I've decided to create a series of short screencasts on Castle and Monorail. This first one, <a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/screencasts/1/">Getting Started with Monorail</a>, covers the bare essentials of getting your first project up and running.</p>
<p><a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/screencasts/1/">http://colinramsay.co.uk/screencasts/1/</a></p>
<p>It shows downloading and installing the Castle MSI, creating a new Visual Studio project, and getting something up on the browser. It really is basic but it was a necessary introduction to the others which I plan on doing. Sorry for the poor sound quality during some sections, and do listen out for a greeting from my cat within the first few sections.</p>
<p>Next time round I plan on doing something practical with Monorail, including databinding, layouts, filters, and some of the built in helpers.</p>
