<p>This is pretty old, but one of those films, like Spiderman, which I never got around to seeing. Patrick Stewart remains consistantly ace in everything he's in - so that's a bonus. Halle Berry was shit, but her part was too. There was a great moment just as she chucked Toad off the Statue of Liberty - as she moves through the doors forcing air and debris past her, that looked ace.</p>
<p>I did get the feeling that the whole thing was a prelude to a franchise, but nonetheless 7/10 - an enjoyable romp.</p>
