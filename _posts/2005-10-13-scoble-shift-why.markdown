<p><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/10/12.html#a11430">Scoble's blog is moving</a> and the first thought I had was "why?". Surely the it'll cause a world of pain to shift URLs and all that. Is Robert's current system so limiting that it's worth the hassle? I toyed with moving to Typo for my blog but the Lighttpd setup was just not happening for me. The effort really wasn't worth the gain. Is it worth it for Robert?</p>
