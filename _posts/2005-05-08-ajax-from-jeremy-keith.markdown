<p><a href="http://adactio.com/">Jeremy</a> has <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/display.php/20050428161517.xml">revealed</a> <a href="http://elsewhere.adactio.com/">Adactio Elsewhere</a>, an aggregation of his external information sources in one Ajax powered subsite. It's a great demo of this upcoming techology being used to update only the parts of the page that are actually changing. It actually makes the developer's work a lot easier once all the Ajax framework is in place.</p>
