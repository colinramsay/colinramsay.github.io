<p>I posted briefly about this idea recently, when I mentioned <a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/diary/archives/000337.html">Joshua Flanagan's excellent regex wrapper</a>. I didn't appreciate it as an overall concept then though, the idea of writing a quick wrapper around something to improve your overall code. Jon Galloway talks a little about this idea in his post "<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2006/12/06/a-simple-example-of-a-fluent-interface.aspx">a simple example of a fluent interface</a>", and also links to some more <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html">fluent interface examples on Martin Fowler's website</a>. Ayende's <a href="http://www.ayende.com/Blog/NHibernateQueryGenerator15IsDoneTimeWithMagic.aspx">recent work</a> with Active Record and nHibernate 1.2 are good examples of this idea as well.</p>
