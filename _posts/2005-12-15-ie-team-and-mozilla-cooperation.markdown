<p>Microsoft's Internet Explorer team has met with John Lilly and Chris Beard of Mozilla and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rssteam/archive/2005/12/14/503778.aspx">agreed to use a single RSS icon</a> for both products. The current Firefox icon will be used; it's pretty nice and this shows that Microsoft really do have good intentions when it comes to interoperation and user experience.</p>
