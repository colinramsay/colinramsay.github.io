<p>Just a quick pointer in response to a comment, all of the posts I make are categorised, and those categories can be accessed by hacking the URL. For example, <a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/diary/category/screencasts/">http://colinramsay.co.uk/diary/category/screencasts/</a> will list all of my screencast posts. The obvious problem with that is that you'd need to know what the categories were in the first place, so as part of an ongoing blog redesign, I've included the categories of a post underneath the post title.</p>
<p>You can also hack the URL to browse by date, for example <a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/diary/2008/03">http://colinramsay.co.uk/diary/2008/03</a> shows all of the posts I made in March this year, and <a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/diary/2007">http://colinramsay.co.uk/diary/2007</a> shows all of the posts from last year.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I'm in the middle of a redesign, but the main change you should be able to see is in the readability of my posts; I've increased the font size and the line height to make it a lot easier on the eyes.</p>
