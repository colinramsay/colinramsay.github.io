<p>There's a good discussion going on in <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/archives/008388.html">this comments thread</a> about whether to use CSS or tables to markup an input form.</p>
<p>It all started because <a href="http://www.gerv.net">Gerv</a> wasn't sure how it could be achieved in CSS. Quite a few people referred to <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/forms.html">this Quirksmode article</a>; others just posted the solution inline. Then <a href="http://glazman.org/weblog/">Glazman</a> comes in saying that tables are the way to go and it all kicks off... in a good way.</p>
