<p><a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/writeboard_the_appless_webapp.php>37 Signals announce</a> their next marketing masterpiece - <a href="http://www.writeboard.com/">Writeboard</a>. As usual, they're keeping zipped about exactly what this is going to be.</p>
<p>I use Basecamp on a daily basis - I find it to be pretty useful; their other stuff less so. What I do find interesting is that they are a high profile company coming out with well written, original web apps on a consistant basis.</p>
