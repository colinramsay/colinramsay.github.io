<p>Firefox is busy snatching marketshare from IE, and it looks like they're gearing up to take from Outlook next. Thunderbird is very good, but with the proliferation of excellent webmail services, it doesn't have a huge mass-market appeal. By promoting the Lightning/Thunderbird combo off the back of Firefox, Mozilla are going to be able to appeal to one of the core aspects of Microsoft's business.</p>
