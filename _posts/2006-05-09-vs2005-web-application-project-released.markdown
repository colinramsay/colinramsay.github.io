<p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/05/08/445742.aspx">Scott Guthrie has announced</a> the release of version 1.0 of <a href="http://webproject.scottgu.com/">Visual Studio 2005 Web Application Project</a>. This brings the VS2003 style web projects to VS2005, providing Project files, removing app_code directories, and all of the code is compiled into a single deployable assembly which can be referenced. It also enables Edit and Continue for Web Projects in VS2005.</p>
<p>This is the way it should have been done in the first place. When we moved to VS2005, the clunky nature of the default web project was a nightmare, and I'm not really sure how it was supposed to benefit developers. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net/reference/infrastructure/wap/default.aspx">You can get the VS2005 Web Application Project here</a>.</p>
