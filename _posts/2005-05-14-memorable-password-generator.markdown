<p><a href="http://www.gerv.net/">Gerv</a> recently talked about <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/archives/008109.html">a new form of memorable password</a>, and asked if anyone wanted to knock up a test of the idea. So I did.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.happyandlost.co.uk/passwordgen/" title="Memorable Passwords">Memorable Passwords</a>.</p>
<p>Written first in VBScript as a test, then in C# to make it fast enough to use. I'll be writing a webservice around this very soon, maybe someone would like to use it to generate passwords for new user accounts somewhere?</p>
