<p>I expect to get a bit done tonight for my project review in the morning. Here's what I'm going to present:</p>
<p>* backend admin system<br />
* news/features with integrated comments<br />
* shopping cart system<br />
* band front end<br />
* band back end<br />
* beginnings of streaming radio<br />
* beginnings of a Flash song composition app<br />
* associated chatroom system for above</p>
<p>Now, these are all well and good, but I need to think of what I'm going to do to make it all more media-oriented. The Flash app should help, it's going to have a ton of samples and is very interactive. But I need visual stuff. I'm thinking t-shirt designer to start with. I don't want to do any video stuff - the web isn't ready for it, and an offline component to this project is not appropriate in my opinion. But this is supposed to be a "Media Project" and I suspect that what I've produced so far won't meet that description well enough.</p>
