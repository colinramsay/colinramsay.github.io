<p><a href="http://www.projectaardvark.com/posts/hickswright/june/13.html">This is where it's at</a>. Company moral can be hugely affected by things that happen <em>outside</em> the workplace. So if the company can manufacture good things that happen outside, then good stuff!</p>
<p>Actually the whole Project Aardvark idea is a a very good one, and it's been extremely well implemented thus far. Grab some interns, put them to work on a secret project, and leak details on the product and the process via a blog.</p>
