<p>Apparently the forums in <a href="http://www.communityserver.org/">Community Server</a> can be <a href="http://scottwater.com/blog/archive/2005/10/10/cs_with_email.aspx">browsed, and posted to via NNTP and e-mail</a>. This is such a good idea; I've toyed with doing some kind of PHPbb screen scraping service which sent out digests and the like, but this sort of integration is much better.</p>
