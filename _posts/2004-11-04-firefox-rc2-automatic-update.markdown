<p>I'm not as in to the Mozilla stuff as I was a year or so ago, but I decided to test the auto-update facility that they have lined up for Firefox 1.0. I fiddled with some settings in my 1.0PR and hit the big red button. </p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>Well, not quite. The update downloaded, but it destroyed my profile. I've deleted it now, and still things aren't working - the back button for one. I really hope, for Mozilla's sake that I am a big freak of nature and the Firefox 1.0 release doesn't do this to too many people...</p>
