<p>Tim Bray talks about the <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/07/11/New-Public-Relations">new face of public relations</a> - the employees. Get those knowledgable workers out there, talking about the stuff they have a passion for, and you'll get other people excited too. Tim says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Suppose your employees make you look bad? The answer is obvious: if your employees either don?t understand what your company is trying to accomplish, or can?t do a good job of explaining it, then blogs are the least of your problems.</p></blockquote>
<p>So get out there, create a buzz. The masters are 37 Signals, purveyors of hype and the ability to follow up on hype...</p>
