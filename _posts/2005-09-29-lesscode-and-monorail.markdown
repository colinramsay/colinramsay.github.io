<p>I think I know now why my initial impressions of <a href="http://castleproject.org/index.php/MonoRail">MonoRail</a> weren't very good. While they were adhering to the letter of the Ruby On Rails ideas, they weren't really getting with the spirit. And example would be the MonoRail homepage - it's a wiki. And their docs are all over the place. And setting up a MonoRail project isn't as simple as typing "rails project" at a command line. There are lots of examples.</p>
<p>Apparently <a title="Lesscode Is Not About Quantity [@lesscode.org]" href="http://lesscode.org/2005/09/28/lesscode-is-not-about-quantity/">Lesscode Is Not About Quantity</a>. I agree. It's about the <em>idea</em>, the <em>practises</em>, the spirit of it. It's not enough for MonoRail to copy Rails and try and shoehorn it into a .NET environment. It needs to be <em>adapted</em> to use that platform's strengths.</p>
