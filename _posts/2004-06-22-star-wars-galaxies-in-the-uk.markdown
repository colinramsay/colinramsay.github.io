<p>So I've been trying to get hold of Star Wars Galaxies through UK online shops. Amazon doesn't have any, I should know because I had it on order and it was always 1-2 weeks away. Trawling real high street shops came to nothing as well.</p>
<p>Then I noticed that FilePlanet has a 14 day trial offer on - they let you download the game from them then activate it with a credit card. Fileplanet kindly informed me that they had a wait of over two hours to download the trial. They probably also have a bandwidth cap. So I grabbed the filename, typed it into Google and found a <a href="http://www.gamekapocs.hu/jatekok/PC/starwarsgalaxies/files/SWG_Trial_GSI_2.EXE">site</a> which was mirroring it. </p>
<p>A few hours of 180k/s downloading later and I have it. Just getting it installed now :D</p>
