<p>MOP - Cold As Ice; just fun.</p>
<p>Anyways, nothing's happening really. I've wrapped up three websites at work this week - it's quite odd saying that since I usually finish one site a year or so :)</p>
<p>The Uni project is going to be called Groundswell and will be coming soon. It's gonna make me and Izzo millionaires.</p>
<p>Finally? When you depart from me sorrow abides, and happiness takes his leave.</p>
