<p>In this screencast, <a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/screencasts/2/">Using Monorail</a>, I demonstrate some of the features of Monorail, such as layouts, rescues, filters and basic databinding to create a login form and a restricted area within a website.</p>
<p><a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/screencasts/2/">http://colinramsay.co.uk/screencasts/2/</a></p>
<p>Even I got a bit confused about usage of HtmlHelper and FormHelper in RC2, but I think I made clear that FormHelper was where the action is at. Next time I'm going to talk about basic ActiveRecord stuff andsome more databinding. Don't forget to check out my first screencast, <a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/screencasts/2/">Getting Started with Monorail</a>.</p>
