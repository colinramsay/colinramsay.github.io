<p><a href="http://www.kottke.org/" title="Jason Kottke">Jason Kottke</a> collects together reasons on why <a href="http://www.kottke.org/04/04/everything-is-broken" title="Everything is Broken">everything is broken</a>. I agree with his conclusion ("And yet, people seem to be getting lots of things done on the Internet these days.") - as far as I'm concerned everything is just sweet.</p>
<p>The Internet is a stunning achievement. We can routinely mine the largest encylopedia that has ever existed from a <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/" title="Google">simple form</a>. We can collect together information from a huge number of sources and have them <a href="http://fls.moo.jp/moz/rssreader.html" title="Firefox RSS Reader Panel">presented to us</a> in a consise and timely manner. We can <a href="http://messenger.msn.com/">communicate instantly</a>, no matter where we are in the world, and send images and video, with ease. </p>
<p>The Internet is not broken. It's just thinking what to do next.</p>
