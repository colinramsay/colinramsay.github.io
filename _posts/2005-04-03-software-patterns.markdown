<p>Apparently "design patterns are recurring solutions to software design problems you find again and again in real-world application development". Sounds good to me, saves me reinventing the wheel. Trouble is, I do find all this OOP stuff rather hard, but the <a href="http://www.dofactory.com/Patterns/Patterns.aspx">Data and Object Factory</a> have kindly given me not only abstract examples, but real world examples in C#. Nice people.</p>
