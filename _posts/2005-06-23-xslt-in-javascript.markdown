<p>Thank you Google. Your lovely little <a href="http://goog-ajaxslt.sourceforge.net/">library lets us do client side XSLT transforms</a> independent of the core browser tech. </p>
<p>Why? Because XML is a great way of transmitting small datasets, and if you're using AJAX tech.... oohh... Send XML back to the client and let them worry about the UI stuff.</p>
