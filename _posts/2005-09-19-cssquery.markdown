<p>I've seen a couple of these scripts around (notably Simon WIllison's version) but knowing the quality of work Dean Edwards has produced, I'll give this a shot. It's a <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/my/cssQuery/">javascript function which lets you select elements using CSS selectors</a>. It'll return a javascript array of matching elements. </p>
<p>I've been using this technique lately to get elements which don't have a known ID until they've been processed by server side code.</p>
