<p>This album is worth listening to for the sheer filth of the bass about three minutes into track eight, The City Consumes Us. Totally at odds with the rest of the song, yet utterly fitting, this is an unexpected darkness in a track which is otherwise filled with lovely. </p>
<p>Keep an eye out for more on this album in the next few weeks.</p>
