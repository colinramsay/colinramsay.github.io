<p>Holy shit man, now MP3.com has redesigned with a fantastic CSS based design. Found via <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/" title="Stop Design">Doug Bowman,</a> we can see nice use of curved boxes and the <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/slidingdoors2/" title="A List Apart">sliding doors</a> method.</p>
<p>With the three sites I've mentioned today it's becoming harder and harder for anyone to justify staying with tables.</p>
