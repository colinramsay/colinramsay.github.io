<p>I've spent the day making a Flash website design and a Flash streaming MP3 player. It's been pretty good actually, Flash is fairly powerful when you know what you're doing.</p>
<p>I came across a problem when making the MP3 player - I wanted to make it a little more dynamic by turning it into a streaming jukebox for all the MP3s within a specified directory. Unfortunately, Flash's file and directory handling is shite, but we wanted to embed the player in a web page - this gave me access to further scripting power via ASP.</p>
<p>The solution is to have the ASP page create a directory listing in a Flash - readable text file before the .swf even runs. Then we can use a few string functions to create an array of all the MP3s. </p>
<p>Note to self: make use of all the tools available to you.</p>
