<p><a href="http://cake.allrecipes.com/az/nMintChcltIcing.asp" title="icing"></a>I know nothing about baking, but this <a href="http://cake.allrecipes.com/recipes/print_fullpage_scale.asp?nprid=15391&servings=8&metric=1&size=3" title="chocolate cake">chocolate cake recipe</a> is easy peasy. Mine didn't rise very well but it tastes good. I used <a href="http://cake.allrecipes.com/az/nMintChcltIcing.asp" title="icing">this icing</a> as well. The worst bit is cleaning up :(</p>
