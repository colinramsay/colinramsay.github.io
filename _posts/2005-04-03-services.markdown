<p>I wrote a chatroom using C# sockets and Flash, with XML messages being used to transport data. Now it had one main issue - each XML message was about 1.5k. With one of these being sent every second from every connected client, my home broadband connection (upload speed of 15k/s) was quickly saturated.</p>
<p>Ok, fine. I will put it on one of the Internetware servers - they have compression on IIS and a ton of bandwidth. But the problem is that this chatroom was a console app, and therefore would only run when someone was logged onto the server. </p>
<p>What I needed was to turn it into a Windows Service, like IIS or the Background Transfer service used in Windows Update. Services can run in the background under a certain user, but that user doesn't necessarily have to be logged in...</p>
<p>I didn't do it, because I didn't know how at the time. But now <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/CumpsD/archive/2005/04/03/396930.aspx">David Cumps has shown me the way</a>. Maybe I'll give it another bash...</p>
