  content: I thought SpringFramework.NET was amazing and that StructureMap was way
    overcomplicated and not worth the effort learning.  Then, I discovered autowiring
    of dependencies (and the fact that Spring didn't/doesn't really support it)

<p>At one point, nearly five years ago now, I not only used DataGrids.... <a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/diary/2003/11/21/datagrids/">I liked them</a>. I've learned a lot since then, I recall thinking the other day that Microsoft must have had a bit of an off year when they decided to release a web development platform which pretty much relied on the client having Javascript available.</p>
<p>Have you made any claims in the past which you'd like to own up to now? Or do you think any of the current fads of today are going to look foolish in five years time?</p>
