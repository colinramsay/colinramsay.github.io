<p>So Counter-Strike is to be updated to use Valve's Source engine and will be made available with HL2 as part of it's multiplayer component. I've been sitting on IRC and various community sites for the past few hours reporting for www.csnation.net and now I'm listening to Half-Life Radio because they've promised an interview with Gabe & Doug from Valve. Quite when this interview will start is anyone's guess.... zzzz</p>
