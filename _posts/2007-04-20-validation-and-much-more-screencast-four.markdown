<p>In the <a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/screencasts/4/">fourth screencast</a> in the <a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/category/screencasts/">series</a>, Validation and Much More, I talk about how to add validation to your objects and how to show validation failures to the user. There's more on FormHelper and I introduce the PropertyBag and Flash. This is a consolidation episode, where I take the work we've done so far and fill in some of the common blanks. It's very much reliant on having seen the <a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/category/screencasts/">previous screencasts</a> as I am using the same Visual Studio project throughout.</p>

<p>One point of relevance: the use of ActiveRecord with Monorail is <strong>completely optional</strong>. I've used it here because I feel they integrate well, but if you've got another persistance framework which you'd prefer to use then that's possible too!</p>
<p>This screencast shows many of the small but very useful aspects of Monorail, and shows off the awesome binding abilities of FormHelper. For the next screencast I plan on taking a break from the normal series and into the Contrib project to talk about ActiveWriter and the CodeGenerator, projects which can make working with Monorail even easier!</p>
