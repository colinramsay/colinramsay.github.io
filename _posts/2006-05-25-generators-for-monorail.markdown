<p>After a little bit of encouragement in the comments, <a href="http://macournoyer.blogspot.com/">Marc-Andr&eacute; Cournoyer</a> has come up with <a href="http://macournoyer.blogspot.com/2006/05/code-generation-and-scaffolding.html">an excellent command-line generator for Monorail and ActiveRecord</a>. I wanted to use the scaffolding generator to dump out editable templates for a quick administration system, but his initial release didn't support the .rails extension or Areas. Marc promptly wrote this in and he now delivers an excellent way of achieving what I wanted. <a href="http://macournoyer.blogspot.com/2006/05/code-generation-and-scaffolding.html">Thank you Marc</a>. Now make it do a UI for many-to-many relationships and I'll be a very happy man!</p>
