<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk">The Beeb</a> has <a href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk/news/archives/2005/05/backstagebbccou.html">launched</a> <a href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk/">backstage</a>, a free collection of feeds and APIs to allow us to query their data. The BBC is a huge source of information, so it's good to see they're letting us get our hands on it on our own terms. I look forward to seeing what's going to come from <a href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk/data/Data">this</a>.</p>
