  content: ! "I am looking for a particular ticket tape script. Do you have a script
    that will allow for background color change, you can stop the scrolling, and the
    text is from a text file, not in the web coding. If I'm unavilable to update the
    information, I want others to be able to update the information from a text file
    that also allows you to change the background color.\r\nWas that clear, or do
    you have questions?\r\nThank you"

<p>I've updated my Javascript TickerTape component after <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/tickertape-scrolling-tickers-in-javascript">Ajaxian reported</a> that the demo wasn't working for them in Firefox. This is v1.01 and contains no other changes. To download this update, hit the <a href="http://javascript-ticker-tape.googlecode.com/files/tickertape-1.0.zip">current TickerTape version</a> link. <strong>Note that if you've visited the demo before you may need to flush your cache to see this fix</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> The <a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/diary/2009/01/14/javascript-tickertape-on-google-code/">TickerTape is now available on Google Code</a>. Downloads have been updated to reflect this.</p>
