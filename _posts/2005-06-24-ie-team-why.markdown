<p>Even after <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/06/23/431980.aspx">reading the comments</a> on the blog post, I couldn't believe that <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dhtmltechcol/dndhtml/roundcorners.asp">the article</a> would be this bad.</p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dhtmltechcol/dndhtml/roundcorners.asp">Microsoft tell us how to do rounded corners using CSS</a> in the current version of IE. But there are loads of better implementations using clean semantic mark up.</p>
<p>Seriously. MSDN has good, modern articles on a wide range of topics. Why can't they get with the web zeitgeist?</p>
