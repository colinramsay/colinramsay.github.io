  content: Brilliant demo. I  think that it would be much more practical if you integrate

  content: SwfUploadPanel isn't really the same thing - it pops up a separate window
    and allows for queuing of multiple files. In many scenarios that's just unnecessary.

<p>My <a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/diary/category/screencasts/">screencasts</a> are consistently popular, so I thought I'd <a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/screencasts/extjsupload/">create another</a> which talks about a slick usage of my favourite JS framework, <a href="http://www.extjs.com/">Ext JS</a>. In this screencast, I show how to display images stored on a server directory using a PHP JSON backend which provides data to an Ext DataView. I then allow deletion of these images and uploading of new images in an Ajax-style fashion, with no page refreshes.</p>
<p>This approach can be useful when editing a complex form - the details of a product you're selling on your ecommerce site, for example - and you want to upload images without having to repopulate the other form fields when the page reloads, as it would with a standard file upload.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/screencasts/extjsupload/">view the screencast here</a> or download the full <a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/screencasts/extjsupload/extjs-upload.zip">download the source code</a>. I use loeppky's BrowseButton extension for Ext 2, which you can read more about at <a href="http://extjs.com/forum/showthread.php?t=29032">his forum post</a>. I hope you enjoy <a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/screencasts/extjsupload/">the screencast</a> which is provided in association with <a href="http://www.plastiscenic.co.uk">Plastiscenic Ltd</a>.</p>
