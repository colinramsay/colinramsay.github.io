<p>Embrace are number one in the UK album charts with their fourth album, Out Of Nothing. The knobber who presents the chart fucked up the tense final bit so it wasn't immediately clear whether Embrace had beaten Paul Weller. I couldn't believe it until they actually said the words.</p>
<p>Embrace, six years after they topped the charts with TGWO, are the biggest selling band in the UK this week. </p>
<p>I laughed, the tremling hands stopped and my eyes leaked and I shook my head. I've barely been able to believe this week - going into shops where the shelves have beens scoured clean of OON. Today has been the culmination of everything we've believed in since 1997. Today, they won.</p>
