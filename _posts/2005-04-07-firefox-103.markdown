<p>Apparently <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/007905.html">Firefox 1.0.3 is now testing</a> - these point releases are mostly security. However, with this one it seems like there could be a possibility of some extensions breaking. Considering that I, as well as hundreds of thousands of other Firefox users get these releases via Automatic Update, it will be a PR disaster if their much vaunted extension system starts breaking each time an update occurs...</p>
