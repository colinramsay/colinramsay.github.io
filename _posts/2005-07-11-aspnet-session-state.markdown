<p>Recently at work we have been discussing how to write scalable applications with ASP.NET, and one of the issues raised was handling session state. We were aware of the ability to store a session in SQL Server, but none of us had enough practical experience to speak authoritatively.</p>
<p>And then an article on <a href="http://forums.asp.net/7504/ShowPost.aspx">Understanding Session State</a> drops into my Bloglines account.</p>
