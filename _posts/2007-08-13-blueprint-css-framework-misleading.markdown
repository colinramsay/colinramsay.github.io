<p>Blueprint is a "CSS framework, which aims to cut down on your CSS development time", and is similar to the YUI Grid project which had a lot of coverage last year. It's kicking up a bit of a fuss because it requires you to use particular CSS class names within your HTML, in order to get a particular layout for your page.</p>
<p>Surely the conclusion to draw from this is that Blueprint isn't really a CSS framework, but it's an augmentation for HTML? You don't actually have to get involved with CSS at all to use Blueprint, instead relying on marking up your HTML to fit your design...</p>
