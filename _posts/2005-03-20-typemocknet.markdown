<p><a title="Easier legacy unit testing with TypeMock.NET" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2005/03/20/395261.aspx">Easier legacy unit testing with TypeMock.NET</a></p>
<p>"For example, it allows one to "Mock" a real class, not just an interface. It goes further by letting you "Mock" a type's static methods and essentially take over whenever someone instantiates a new instance of a particular type. This would come in very handy in situations like legacy code testing."</p>
<p>I imagine you could use it to refactor code as well. Chop out a particular class and replace it with a mocked version to see what happens.</p>
