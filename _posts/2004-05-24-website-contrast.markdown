<p><a href="http://www.zeldman.com">Zeldman's</a> recent redesign was a little controversial for some. The colour scheme meant that laptop users (with their silly LCD screens) were having difficulty reading the text. He "fixed" it with a <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/contrast/">stylesheet switcher</a> which gave access to a high contrast version.</p>
<p>Over at <a href="http://superfluousbanter.org">Superfluous Banter</a>, they've been <a href="http://superfluousbanter.org/archives/000189.php">talking about</a> using shades of dark gray instead of black when you've got a light coloured background. And then they <a href="http://superfluousbanter.org/archives/000194.php">put a little more thought </a>into in, have linked to these <a href="http://www.nundroo.com/superblog/contrast.html">examples of contrast comparison</a> and opened their comments to opinions. Some of the new stylish CSS sites are falling down on this very issue - using washed out, mellow colours which do nothing for readability.</p>
