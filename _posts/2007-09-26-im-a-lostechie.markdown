<p>I was recently asked to join the community of bloggers at www.lostechies.com. There are already a number of great posts on there and I was really pleased to be able to contribute my first - <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/colin_ramsay/archive/2007/09/25/coding-in-style.aspx">Coding C# in Style</a>. I'm not going to be cross-posting from this blog to there so you can subscribe to LosTechies without fear of seeing duplicates, and you'll get to read quality posts from the other guys there.</p>
