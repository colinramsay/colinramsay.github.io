<p>So, Apple+Option+CTRL+8 <a href="http://www.massless.org/blogger/php/2005/07/inverting-mac-screen-with-keystroke.php">inverts the colours of your display</a> in OS X. That's nice and handy if you're having trouble with the contrast of something. But... why "8"? None of the other digits do anything...</p>
