<p>Yesterday's entry was a little bit rushed. Today's a proper working day so I'll write the post as the day goes on.</p>
<p><strong>Moving Up Country by James Yorkston & The Athletes</strong>  (<a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/colinramsay/playlist/6qEePSw4gIqovJePVwLKNd">spotify link</a>)<br />
I really enjoy James Yorkston's stuff. This is 10 years old now, and I only listened to it for the first time last week. This was my second run through, and it's beginning to capture me.</p>
<p><strong>Hello Land by Guillemots</strong><br />
Notice about this release dropped into my inbox yesterday and I bought it this morning. Unexpectedly, I rather enjoyed it. Guillemots last two albums have been mostly mediocre, with Fyfe's ventures into popland spilling into Guillemots' music. This seemed better, and will definitely get a few more listens.</p>
<p><strong>Diamond Mine by King Cresote & Jon Hopkins</strong> (<a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/5jdm2D6gY3GQXGmVRTKBZN">spotify link</a>)<br />
First listen. Bats in the Attic particularly beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>Boys and Girls by Alabama Shakes</strong> (<a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/colinramsay/playlist/19HqAY7DjLUWurfUO9mfYa">spotify link</a>)</p>
<p>Didn't know what to expect from this so I was pleasantly surprised. Good vocals with a classic jangley guitar sound, without sounding cliched. Needs more listens are in order to see if the songs stand up to the promise.</p>
<p><strong>In The Yard by Neil Morgan</strong> (<a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/colinramsay/playlist/2s5rNgEThgevVZI3cMnFbg">spotify link</a>)</p>
<p>Wank.</p>
<p><strong>The First Big Weekend by Arab Strap</strong> (<a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/4BKJRy9GPS4Y3t61S1xEhF">spotify link</a>)</p>
<p>Lovely day here in Falmouth town and for some reason this popped into my head as I walked down the street, so I listened to it when I got back.</p>
<p><strong>Port of Morrow by The Shins</strong> (<a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/colinramsay/playlist/0GhUqKzdDxEk3sWXVlL1Oo">spotify link</a>)</p>
<p>The first two tracks are great, but I haven't got into the rest yet.</p>
<p><strong>1972 by Josh Rouse</strong> (<a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/5SxkCsVQLLCt5edqjNvssO">spotify link</a>)</p>
<p>A bit of reminiscing...</p>
