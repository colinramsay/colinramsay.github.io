<p>Well after the last post it's become even clearer that this site format isn't very good for posting code on. I'm working on a LFS rebuild of my server, because frankly I don't like the amount of unused shit that Redhat put on there. After getting that going, and getting networking and Apache with Perl & PHP on there, I'll be deploying a new site design which is more of a "hub" for the work I'm doing. This diary will be the front page - which at the moment is basically a content free splash page - and will link to everything else.</p>
<p>That's probably two to three months away though...</p>
