<p><a href="http://www.javarss.com/">This site has added Ajax support</a>. It doesn't stop it from being horrifically designed and poorly implemented. Ajax is not a magic wand which will cure the web of its woes. It's a facilitator, an aid. Just like transparent PNG, or SIFR, or any number of clever tricks, it helps us make something cool but it doesn't make something cool. <a href="http://www.ajaxian.com/archives/2005/05/showcase_javars.html">Ajaxian</a> has this marked as a showcase; a showcase of how Ajax can be used as an excuse for a truly thoughtful UI I assume.</p>
<p>Even more ingenious - the preference to switch on this "feature" is called "ajax mode". The is nothing in the way of inline explanation and the detailed explanation contains a great deal of code....</p>
