<p><a title="Word Complete 1.0" href="http://www.challenger.se/samples/woco.htm">Word Complete 1.0</a> is a T9 style interface for the web. I'm not really sure what this is useful for but the speed of it is very cool. Combining stuff like this with inline spellchecking makes for a very nice editing environment on the web - compared to what we've had in the past at least.</p>
