<p>For those of us who are keyboard fiends, <a title="adot's notblog* "firefox, cats, mars, and more"" href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/">asa</a> <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/007992.html">reports</a> on <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/dougt/">DougT's</a> new Firefox builds with spacial navigation enabled.</p>
<p>Essentially this lets you navigate through all the links on a page using the up, down, left and right arrows. This saves you tabbing through stuff.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://www.meer.net/~dougt/snav/m3/">grab a test build here</a>. I hope that this will get into the default FF build - it is low impact and doesn't need a UI, but it's another one of those features that could keep it a little bit ahead of the game.</p>
