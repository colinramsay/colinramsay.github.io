After nine months in gestation, Packt have released my first solo book - [Ext JS Application Development Blueprints](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/ext-js-application-development-blueprints). I'm really proud of the end result, and I hope that it helps some people get to grips with a framework that is bursting at the seams with advanced features.

It looks at app development from various levels - from that of an architect guiding a team, to that of a solo developer - and provides a look at the theory of application architecture with MVC and MVVM in Ext JS before moving on to look at the tooling provided by Sencha Command.

There are five chapters of practical examples, building small applications from scratch and learning how to use features like data binding and routing. The last two chapters touch of performance and debugging, and various approaches to testing in Ext JS.

It's a whistlestop tour but it's not supposed to be the be-all and end-all. Rather than tell you what to do, step by step, it tries to encourage independent learning and foster an ability to consider your options. As well as being a book about Ext JS, I tried to write something that, in a small way, might help people become better developers. Hopefully anyone that reads it will get a bit of both from it. 

[Ext JS Application Development Blueprints](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/ext-js-application-development-blueprints) is available in both physical and digital formats now.
