  content: ! "Reality check ....\n\nNVU is way off a 1.0 release.. the template support
    is very very buggy, biggest one is scripting support \n\nWhat would have made
    it a great is if they added in support for more scripting langs -- this is just
    a glaring oversight - I know the argument about tags not being XML, but I'd argue
    that NVU isnt and shouldnt be an XML editor .. to quote their home page .. its
    claiming to be \"The complete web authoring system\" - at least give an option
    for supporting rather than alienate ASP, .Net, JSP and other scripting languages
    (including RoR)\n\nI really had high hopes for 1.0 and thought they would have
    sorted some of the silly templating bugs but I feel its a bit of a disappointment.\n\nTo
    finish on a positive, its a great achivement for the team, its a x-platform web
    authoring system, its fast and has direct support for projects - certainly kicks
    butt on some of the other editors out there\n\nI'll not throw away FP or DW just
    yet ....\n\n"
