<p>I've experienced this Jet error on my <a href="http://www.happyandlost.co.uk">Embrace fansite, Happy and Lost</a>, as well as on our development server at work.</p>
<p>At work I was creating a new database object every time I needed to do a DB call - not clever. So I added a check which said:</p>
<pre>
if (db == null)
    db.Create();
</pre>
<p>Or code to that effect, anyway. Worked like a charm but I don't know why. It must be something to do with concurrent connections, but I never saw any decent solution online so this may help someone.</p>
