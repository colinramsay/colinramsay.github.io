<p>I've just finished watching the third film in the LOTR saga. First up - it's too long. Yes, there was enough plot to fill it, but it was too long. Add into that the fact that the end is very poorly structured, and I am very glad I didn't see it at the cinema.</p>
<p>Other than that, it's a magnifcent film. It's beautifully done; there is little of the awkward CGI that scathed the first film. The wisdom of Peter Jackson's choice of location is clearer than ever here. The battles are spectacular, the acting very good, the cheese minimal. All through it (the points where you manage to catch your breath) you're just thinking... how? How did Jackson manage to do this? The vision, the dedication and the strength which went into achieving this are stunning.</p>
