<p>Is there nothing better than Nero? That's a 100 megabyte download, and most of the stuff that it tries to install has nothing to do with burning to CD.... <a href="http://www.burnatonce.com/">burnatonce</a> is brilliant for CDs, but it requires a ProDVD license (which is free) to work. Surely there is a middle ground?</p>
<p><i>Edit:</i> In actual fact I had a non-commercial license for ProDVD kicking around, so burnatonce was actually really easy for me to sort out. The original point remains.</p>
