<p>I've written a website I'm calling Metatorrent. It reads RSS feeds from Metacritic and directly links you to torrent files for the music, DVD and films shown there. It's quite slow - I'm not using any caching and I'm doing screenscraping on www.torrentz.com to get my torrent files - but it does exactly what I wanted and it only took a day to write.</p>
<p>Trouble is, I'm not sure of the legality of it - I'm reproducing some of Metacritic's stuff and I'm scraping www.torrentz.com... So it's for my personal use only - an easy way to get the latest releases.</p>
