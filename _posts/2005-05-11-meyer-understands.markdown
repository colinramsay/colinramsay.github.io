<p><a href="http://meyerweb.com/">Eric Meyer</a> knows what all this <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2005/05/11/connected/">technology is really about</a>. It's not about RSS, Ajax, streaming video, .NET, Rails, PHP, Atom, semantics, XML, XUL, XAML, or the transmission of information or the code we write, it's about <em>people</em>. Clients, users, friends, family, they're the web. Without them it's just data.</p>
