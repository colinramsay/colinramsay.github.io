<p>Back when <a href="http://www.internetware.co.uk">we</a> had a discreet data access layer, Codesmith looked really useful. I was using it to generate the data access layer, the business objects, and some of our forms. But we're moving away from that now... so maybe the C# led templating that Codesmith provides isn't so useful?</p>
<p>Well... no. I haven't "unlearned" C#, so I may as well use it. I've got a MySQL database which I'm accessing through Ruby. I need a form, so what's to stop me generating in using Codesmith? It's a powerful tool, and <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/ericjsmith/archive/2005/05/04/405673.aspx">it's now at version three</a>, with better template caching and debugging.</p>
