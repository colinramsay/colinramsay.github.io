= The problem

I have a passionate desire to _fix_ the current state of my Linux installation, and to be able to know when files have changed and either revert the changes or store them in source control. Why do I want to do this? Several reasons:

- I like the idea that my system is _disposable_. It should be easy to blow away a Linux install because I know I can restore it easily.
- Rather than being an assemblage of cruft built up over the years, I want it to be surgically pruned as each change is made, with comments where necessary to help me remember why a change was made.
