<p><a href="http://labs.live.com/">Microsoft have launched some new research labs</a> in the hope that they can be more agile. Trouble is that the site which fronts this <a href="http://labs.live.com/">new venture</a> is embarrassingly bad. It doesn't render properly in Firefox, it looks very amateurish, and seems unfinished. In short, it's unprofessional.</p>
<p>That is a complaint I have with all of Microsoft's Live stuff. It just looks <em>shit</em>. The biggest software company in the world are trying to revamp themselves but they don't realise that people will dismiss them because the image that they are using to front this is very poor.</p>
