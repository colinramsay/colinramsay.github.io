<p>Now I find Google to be a very interesting company. A lot of people claim that Google are "the good guys" and I certainly don't believe they are actively twattish. But it would be nice to see them pioneer the way in some area - CSS support, accessibility, some cause that isn't just spawned from their own interest. </p>
<p>Anyway. <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/04/10/gmail-accessibility">Mark Pilgrim talks about Gmail's accessibility</a> - apparently it sucks. Such a move makes it seem like they're more interested in market share than making genuinely brilliant services. A small touch like accessibility is important to some people, and would lift Gmail to another level.</p>
