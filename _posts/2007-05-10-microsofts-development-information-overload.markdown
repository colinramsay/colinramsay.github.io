<p>Jeff Atwood's always awesome <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000845.html">Coding Horror tackles the "Microsoft treadmill"</a>: the range of problems which arise from being a developer in the world of Redmond. Looking at Jeff's list of recent technology from Microsoft did make me shudder, and indeed made me think back to the announcement that the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/adonet/archive/2007/04/28/ado-net-entity-framework-update.aspx">ADO.NET Entity Framework has been delayed</a>.</p>
<p>I remember wondering what the hell the Entity Framework <em>was</em> to begin with, I mean take a look at this further list from the MS research departments:</p>
<p>LINQ, and...<br />
LINQ for SQL, and... various other LINQs<br />
WPF/E<br />
Silverlight<br />
DLR<br />
.NET 3<br />
.NET 3.5<br />
Orcas</p>
<p>So many acronymns! So many releases! And a couple are even <em>the same thing</em>. In some ways, the Microsoft development world is reminiscent of the Live debacle which was unleashed on the world - too many ideas, too little coherence. It should be an exciting time to be a developer in the Microsoft world, but instead, because there is no good, consistant, focused promotion of the direction which Microsoft will be enticing developers to use, it's just confusing.</p>
<p>It does feel like I'm in a minority at the moment, in that I am a developer on the Microsoft platform who actually <em>wants</em> to work there, and doesn't feel that Ruby on Rails or Python is the best thing since sliced bread. <a href="http://castleproject.org/">Castle</a> is what I need to develop, and it is built using Microsoft technology and open source brainpower. To me, it's development heaven.</p>
