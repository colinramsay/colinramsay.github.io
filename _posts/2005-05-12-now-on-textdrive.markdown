<p>I've switched to Textdrive. I'd like to thank Textdrive, Movable Type, MySQL and myself (for remembering the local MySQL password) in achieving this endevour. www.colinramsay.co.uk switched immediately, colinramsay.co.uk didn't. I have no idea why; DNS is a fickle beast. The Linux box is now switched off.</p>
