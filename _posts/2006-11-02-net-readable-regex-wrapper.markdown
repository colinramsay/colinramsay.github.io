<p>Joshua Flanagan presents a library which gives a much more readable syntax to .NET regular expressions. It is also much more verbose, but when it comes to regex I think most would agree this is a good thing. You can find details and examples in his <a href="http://flimflan.com/blog/ReadableRegularExpressions.aspx">blog post on the subject</a>. This came in via <a href="http://www.ayende.com/Blog/ReadableRegexesTheRegularExpressionsDSL.aspx">Ayende</a>.</p>
