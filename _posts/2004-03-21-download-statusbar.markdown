<p>The <a href="http://downloadstatusbar.mozdev.org/">Download Statusbar</a> for Firefox is a great supplement to the download manager. You don't have to have a separate window to track the seamless downloads. It's quite nice to download something without having to choose it's destination directory, but it's even better to get feedback on it's progress.</p>
