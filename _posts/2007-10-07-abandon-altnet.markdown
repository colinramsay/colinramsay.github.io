  content: ! "I think it's really unfortunate that so many people take such offense
    to the ALT.NET community, and the conference.  I was there, and it wasn't at all
    like you describe.  There were developers of all skill levels, and there was productive
    discussion and debate in every session I attended.  There was a great deal of
    respect for all ideas and skillsets.  I learned a ton.  The whole reason I went
    to the conference was to interact with a community of people that were doing things
    I was interested in.  \r\n\r\nI would love it if my local .NET user group did
    more of that stuff, but I really don't think that is their core audience.  And
    that is fine!  They are serving their core audience well.  I am hoping that by
    giving a name to they types of things we are interested in, we can foster a bigger,
    more interactive and INCLUSIVE community that can take root at the local level.
    \ Even my local user group has been breaking out into focus group meetings for
    SQL Server, Office, etc.  Why NOT ALT.NET?  It doesn't mean I won't go to a SQL
    Server meeting and it doesn't mean I don't want a Sharepoint guy to come to an
    ALT.NET meeting.  We can all learn from each other, and that is what I want most.
    \ I learn best from people - and I want to help build that community.  \r\n\r\nOn
    a side note - it would be fantastic if there was more blogging with specific examples
    and tutorials - I am a big fan of your screencasts.  JP Boodhoo does a great job
    with this.  I am still learning a lot of this stuff but I will look for opportunities
    to share as well.  (but nothing beats face-to-face conversation)."

  content: ! "Hanselman quote was in a contextual joke.  My bad for not posting that.\r\n\r\nYour
    example of a conversation at Alt.NET was accurate for a small percentage.  There
    were developers there who did not know anything about any of the sessions and
    they asked serious questions.\r\n\r\nThe conference attendees spent 3 days seeking
    another name because everyone who didn't go is so fixated on the label.  Even
    attendees were.  I personally like Pragmatic.NET but that is just me.\r\n\r\nI
    don't know how many time I heard leaders in the industry state this verbatim:
    \"This is NOT us versus them.\"\r\n\r\n\"...or giving talks at mainstream conferences\"
    \ This is exactly what we did this weekend.  Except the audience was able to interact
    in real-time.  No central speaker."

  content: ! "Well, I'm not sure about the divisive nature of ALT.NET. I was there
    and, as part of the Los Techies crew, I won't deny that I was the least certain
    as to why I was there.\r\n\r\nThere certainly were good sessions and there were
    BAD ones (I was turned off by certain Alpha geeks who would NOT move to a round
    table when one was called for). But in the end, I saw that this group has influence
    over Microsoft. \r\n\r\nAs an example, the MVC architecture presentation where
    Scott Guthrie mentioned a certain CodeBetter individual as a strong influence
    for MVC even coming to fruition. The MVC was very much like Monorail, TDD was
    part of the presentation and so on...\r\n\r\nAre certain techniques alternative?
    Sure... Ruby, maybe. BDD is fairly new.\r\n\r\nBut I'm not for alternative techniques.
    You're right, most of these techniques are old hat for us. Certain individuals
    may have been taking the stand that this was truly an alternative conference...
    if that was the case, then I really didn't see them there at the conference (with
    exception of a few unique notables maybe).\r\n\r\nI don't consider myself a Mort,
    but I'm certainly a Mort wannabe - I'm sure I'll end up one as a result of outside
    influences like family and whatnot. That's why I've placed myself squarely in
    the Microsoft camp. In the end I hope that many of these techniques become truly
    mainstream and frankly, I hope MSFT is the focal point for making them mainstream.
    \r\n\r\nMicrosoft was there - in force - taking notes, tactfully criticizing,
    and demonstrating that they ARE making these ideas mainstream. That part to me,
    was awesome."

  content: Its unfortunate that you weren't there to experience it for yourself, as
    it was nothing like you imagine. There is no line. There is no clique. The reason
    you weren't there is NOT because you weren't allowed to come, it was because you
    chose not to. There is no certification process to be part of ALT.NET. You don't
    have to ask permission. If the idea of looking beyond a single vendor for tools
    and guidance appeals to you, then you are part of the group. That's it.

  content: ! "So, aparently there must be some truth to this Alt.Net thing or you
    would not have felt the need to resort to inflamatory language and name-calling
    - two practices which you seem to be against from this post.\r\n\r\nWhile some
    of what you have stated is valid, much of this post is misguided and some is completely
    false.\r\n\r\nYou state, \"Just as I find it pointless that you√¢??d go to a conference
    to discuss the stuff that everyone there already knows. \"  Your assumption that
    everyone in attendance knew the ins-and-outs of everything is just plain wrong.
    \ Check out my blog post to this effect here:\r\n\r\nhttp://testinfected.blogspot.com/2007/10/altnetconf-cool-tools-dont-make-cool.html\r\n\r\nFor
    another instance, take the fact that the vast majority of attendees could not
    clearly define BDD - one of the very terms that you listed.  I have somewhat awkwardly
    attempted to help the discussion along here:\r\n\r\nhttp://testinfected.blogspot.com/2007/10/altnetconf-behavior-driven-design.html\r\n\r\nDon't
    comment on things that you don't know about.  I won't speculate as to why you
    have stated misrepresentations of the truth such as, \"[The Alt.Net conference]
    mainly serves to allow all of the ALT.NET developers to come together to talk
    about how great it is that they are all ALT.NET\"  But, I will say, \"Nonsense!\"
    \ You weren't there.  The driving force behind the discussions was always better
    understanding of what others are finding to be useful practices.  Everyone learned
    from each other.  Everyone wants to take the things that they learned back to
    their teams and their blog audiences to get better.  \r\n\r\nIf you want more
    detail, ask those that you think have it.  I believe that you will have a hard
    time backing up your assertion that the attendees haven't made an attempt to help
    others understand these concepts.  Two easy counterexamples are Jeremy Miller
    and Martin Fowler.\r\n\r\nThe tone of the conference was actually one of attempting
    to foster unity in the .Net community while at the same time showing the beauty
    of effective tools to others - regardless of who developed them.  \r\n\r\nA different
    idea by its very nature is divisive.  Some will agree while others don't.  While
    this cannot be helped, it can be mitigated if those with new ideas are open and
    accessible.  To that end, I credit you for leaving comments enabled on this post
    while others have ranted and disabled comments."

  content: ! "\"Its unfortunate that you weren√¢??t there to experience it for yourself,
    as it was nothing like you imagine. There is no line. There is no clique.\"\r\nI
    wasn't there (I'm in europe and quite busy, so no time for this conference), but
    just a small piece of insight: \r\nIf you're IN the clique, you don't see there
    IS a clique. Just because the conference was OPEN, doesn't mean large droves of
    people who have never heard of it were there. Most, if not all, attendees were
    there because they heard about the term, have already participated in the discussions
    about the term etc. That's with all conferences which are focussed on a more or
    less narrow scope. \r\n\r\nMind you, I find the idea of a movement who has influence
    on MS interesting and if that movement can come up with a clear mission statement
    I can perhaps join that movement. It's now simply blurry what they stand for (as
    it appears to differ from person to person)."

    so much looking down on everyone else. I'm the last to deny that such a tone ocassionally
    slips into the blogs I'm reading, but I'd have to think that this is often from
    frustration rather than a sense of superiority. However, I don't remember any
    of them being even remotely as negative, insulting and ignorant of realtiy as
    your posting here. \r\nWhy ist here a need? Because some people feel more comfortable
    using this than that. This should be enough justification for anyone to at least
    not be aggressive. Whether you buy into it is a completely different matter."

    help grow with the entire .net community.

  content: ! "Colin, you said:\r\n\"If they really wanted to change things then they
    should be writing about their techniques in detail, coming up with introductory
    guides to DDD, TDD, mocking, creating screencasts, or giving talks at mainstream
    conferences, or producing tools to make the level of entry to these technologies
    lower than it is.\"\r\n\r\nI can come up with many many examples of people that
    were at the conference (and many who weren't) doing exactly those things! Jeremy
    Miller, who many people seem to be attacking, wrote a 14 part blog series on 'writing
    your own CAB' - if that isn't technical detail, what is? Jay Flowers has tools
    like CI Factory that make continuous integration easier. I could go on, but I
    think you see where I am coming from.\r\n\r\nTo me, the most amazing thing about
    the event was that everyone there realizes that the name is divisive, and that
    goes against the spirit of the ideas and values that seemed to be shared. \r\n\r\nI
    hope that everyone can stop being negative and just start \"writing about their
    techniques in detail, coming up with introductory guides to DDD, TDD, mocking,
    creating screencasts, or giving talks at mainstream conferences, or producing
    tools to make the level of entry to these technologies lower than it is.\" \r\n\r\nI

<p>For a few months the term "ALT.NET" has been gaining traction on the blogs I read, starting from a post by <a href="http://laribee.com/blog/2007/04/10/altnet/">David Laribee</a> in April. From there it has taken off, with an ALT.NET Conference taking place this week. So it's perhaps timely that <a href="http://samgentile.com">Sam Gentile</a> has written a post entitled "<a href="http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2007/10/06/goodbye-codebetter-and-alt-net.aspx">Goodbye CodeBetter and ALT.NET</a>" which talks about the ALT.NET movement and some of the people surrounding it.</p>
<h3>ALT.NET is Divisive</h3>
<blockquote><p>ALT.NET is a divisive thing. No matter what they tell you.</p></blockquote>
<p>So says Sam, and I'm in agreement. The ALT.NET conference is so cliquey that it hurts, and that's really highlighted by an interesting bit of news that came out yesterday regarding Microsoft's upcoming MVC framework. I think it's interesting that they'd talk about it at a conference where most of the people will already be using this sort of technology. Just as I find it pointless that you'd go to a conference to discuss <em>the stuff that everyone there already knows</em>. DDD, BDD, MVC - these aren't things that will be unknown to people attending the ALT.NET conference.</p>
<blockquote><p>ALT.NETter A: so... heard of that new BDD business?<br />
ALT.NETter B: Yep.<br />
ALT.NETter A: Oh, well there's this great new idea called DDD!<br />
ALT.NETter B: Yeah, right into that too.<br />
ALT.NETter A: Oh.</p></blockquote>
<p>And so on. But wouldn't that conversation have been a whole lot more interesting if the second developer <em>hadn't</em> heard of those ideas?</p>
<h3>The View from on High</h3>
<p>The ALT.NET conference is barely about the underlying technologies or ideas. It mainly serves to allow all of the ALT.NET developers to come together to talk about how great it is that they are all ALT.NET. Us, and them. Back to Sam:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am not going to use the term "Morts."</p></blockquote>
<p>Good, because it's an offensive term, but it's one that's being thrown around by the ALT.NET gang with abandon. <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott Hanselman</a>, a great blogger, had this to say from the conference:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mort is crying because mommy and daddy are fighting.</p></blockquote>
<p>That's the kind of patronising way in which the term is being used; I mean <em>come on</em>, the damn thing is short for "mortal" which is a pretty clear indication of how the people who use "mort" think of themselves: Gods of their domain. Overseers of the lower developers who haven't had the resources, or the guidance, to work with the fantastic array of non-Microsoft technologies that exist.</p>
<p>And in order to address that imbalance, the ALT.NET mob organise an enormous desert circle-jerk, and I call bullshit. If they really wanted to change things then they should be writing about their techniques in detail, coming up with introductory guides to DDD, TDD, mocking, creating screencasts, or giving talks at mainstream conferences, or producing tools to make the level of entry to these technologies lower than it is.</p>
<h3>Abandon ALT.NET - Before it Goes Too Far</h3>
<p>A lot of people in the ALT.NET camp <a href="http://www.ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/05/01/ALT.Net-It-is-not-us-vs.-them.aspx">may not feel that they're being divisive</a> but I can tell you that by propagating this idea you're creating a line in the sand, with the highly-knowledgable on one side and the masses on the other. You're not encouraging dissemination of your information, you're just creating another impenetrable gang of developers that is almost opaque to the guy on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: I've updated this post on <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/colin_ramsay/">my LosTechies blog</a> - see <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/colin_ramsay/archive/2007/10/08/why-alt-net.aspx">Why ALT.NET</a>?</p>
