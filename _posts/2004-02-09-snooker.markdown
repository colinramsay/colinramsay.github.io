<p>The Masters Snooker was pretty good last night, with the battle of the camp-haired players resulting in Paul Hunter staging the comeback of the year to beat Ronnie O'Sullivan. Unfortunately John Virgo was commentating, and he's a completely offputting twat. THIS ISN'T BIG BREAK JOHN! SHUT UP!!</p>
