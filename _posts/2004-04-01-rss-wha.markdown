<p><a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/">Signal VS Noise</a> asks us to <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000622.php">explain RSS in 10 words or less</a>... My favorite is probably "A list of everything new online since you last looked." or maybe "Get the latest site updates without visiting the webpage."</p>
<p>To be honest, I couldn't be arsed to keep track of my blogroll without some kind of RSS Reader.</p>
