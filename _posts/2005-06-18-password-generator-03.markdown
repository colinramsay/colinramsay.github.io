<p>I've made some changes to the <a href="http://happyandlost.co.uk/passwordgen/">password generator</a> based on some recommendations by <a href="http://www.gerv.net">Gerv</a>. The generator now uses a list of more memorable words. It also throws up ten passwords per request to let you choose your favourite.</p>
