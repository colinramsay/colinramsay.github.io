  content: I usually just say it is a mechanism that handles automatically injecting
    dependencies into your objects (assuming listener is that saavy).  Your explanation
    helps too.

<p>I guess this applies to any IoC container, but you get the idea. How would you describe Windsor to a newcomer in just one sentence? I just wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Windsor is a way of passing in different classes to code that is going to use them, it helps you write applications that are very flexible and testable.</p></blockquote>
<p>But that was pretty off the cuff and I'm not really satisfied with it. Give it a go, it's pretty hard.</p>
