<p>I was suppose to be going to see <a href="http://www.thedelays.co.uk">The Delays</a> on Saturday with Zara and Lairdy but there are rumours that the band may have cancelled both that gig and a date in Sunderland because.... wait for it.... they are recording a CD:UK performance. If this turns out to be true, it's very sad. The fact that a record company can force a band to abandon the fans who have waited, and paid money, specifically to see them in favour of a marketing ploy - it's disgusting.</p>
<p>It's all the worse that I wasn't even arsed about seeing the band, it was just an excuse to see Lairdos and Sherbert Girl again. Fucking "The Delays".</p>
