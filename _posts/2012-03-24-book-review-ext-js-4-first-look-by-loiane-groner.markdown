<p>Quick disclaimer: I received a gratis review copy of this book in exchange for writing about it.</p>
<p>With Ext JS 4 bringing so many changes to the framework, even experienced Sencha developers need a helping hand to understand this new direction. <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/ext-js-4-first-look/book" title="Ext JS 4 First Look" target="_blank">Ext JS 4 First Look</a> hits the sweet spot for both new and existing developers. It doesn't go in-depth, but that's why it's a "first look"; the book touches on all parts of the new release and gives an excellent overview of changes and new features.</p>
<p>The chapters on theming and MVC are particularly welcome, as these are both important facets of Ext JS 4 but ones which are still not well documented. In particular the brief practical examples for theming components and creating custom UIs are a good introduction.</p>
<p>Overall <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/ext-js-4-first-look/book" title="Ext JS 4 First Look" target="_blank">Ext JS 4 First Look</a> serves its purpose well - developers who are new to Sencha will get a feel for what Ext JS is all about, and existing users will see how things have changed since version 3. Kudos to <a href="http://loianegroner.com/" target="_blank">Loiane</a> on this great release!</p>
