<p>Google has launched <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a>, a desktop application which is essentially <a href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a> Xtreme. </p>
<p>It adds in some jazzy 3D tricks, including 3D representations of large American cities. And all for free! But <a href="http://earth.google.com/earth_plus.html">there's a pay version</a> which offers high resolution prints and GPS integration...</p>
<p>I may be wrong, but I think this is the first time Google has released a free product which has a better, bigger, pay-for brother.</p>
