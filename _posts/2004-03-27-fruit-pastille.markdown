<p>Blur's Dave Rowntree has been in touch with NME.com the talk about file sharing:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nme.com/news/107978.htm">I hate the NME</a>.</p>
<p>He's got an interesting opinion on the subject - "What I'm saying is if the BPI wanted to take a stand, then the time to take that stand was a number of years ago and do it in a kind of inclusive and grown-up way rather than now posturing and spitting like a bunch of schoolyard bullies". Quite right young Dave.</p>
