<p>Monorail is ace, but what it really needs is an easy way of supplying test data to unit tests. <a href="http://www.dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/anoras/archive/2005/12/07/134195.aspx">DuckUnit</a> is an interesting little mention by Anders... <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/">Jamie Cansdale</a> of NUnitAddin is working on something which will allow us to delivery data to test classes from XML files. </p>
<p>I hope we hear more of this in the near future.</p>
