<p><a href="http://www.schuerig.de/michael/boilerplate/">Boilerplate</a> is a "general application skeleton" for Rails which provides an advanced list/form view for your data. Quick admin sections, here we come! It's still in very early versions, but something like this could be extremely useful.</p>
