<p>I'm turning www.staticthought.co.uk dynamic before the number of articles gets out of hand. It's a fairly small project, so I've decide to try Ruby on Rails. It's being talked about a lot at the moment, so I'm documenting my experiences in a mini-diary to see how I get on. I'm not doing much each day, so it'll be nice and bitesized. <a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/static/ror/Day%201.html" title="Ruby on Rails - Day One">Day One is an intro</a> and scene setter, <a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/static/ror/Day%202.html" title="Ruby on Rails - Day Two">Day Two gets a bit more technical</a>. Day Three is in fact tomorrow, and I will do some more interesting stuff then.</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>
