<p>Further to my earlier entry about Slashdot's CSS conversion showing that standards based design is making real world in-roads, <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2005/09/26/maintainability">Simon Willison is trying to address the question of maintainable CSS</a>.</p>
<p>As a web developer on large web projects, I am concerned about the maintainability of the C# code we write. But the same standards need to be applied to CSS. With hundreds, if not thousands of styling rules applying to a large site, it's extremely hard to dive into a new CSS layout and understand what's going on.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.digital-web.com/">Digital Web</a> tries to address the fact that CSS isn't something that can be hacked together anymore - it has to be <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/articles/architecting_css/">architected</a>. But while there are a <a href="http://www.cbeyond.net/includes/dom.css">couple</a> of <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/log/2005/05/03/css-tip-flags.html">techniques</a> kicking around to help navigate and arrange your stylesheets, I really think that Simon is correct in trying to bring this issue to the fore. For real enterprise-level acceptance, we need enterprise-level techniques to allow multiple developers to create high quality CSS files.</p>
