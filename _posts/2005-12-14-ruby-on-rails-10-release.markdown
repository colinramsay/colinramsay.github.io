<p><a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/articles/2005/12/13/rails-1-0-party-like-its-one-oh-oh">Ruby on Rails</a>, a <a href="http://lesscode.org/">lesscode</a> framework for the web, has reach version 1.0.</p>
<p>It's great. Cutting edge AJAX functionality, smart database access through Active Record, great MVC implementation with it's controllers and views, native URL rewriting with Routes. Lovely.</p>
<p>Congratulations to David and the rest of the Rails contributers.</p>
