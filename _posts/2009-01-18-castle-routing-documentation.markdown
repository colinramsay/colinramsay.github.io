<p>After a while working on it, I converted the <a href="http://using.castleproject.org/display/MR/Routing+Overview">scratchpad</a> for the routing documentation into a <a href="http://castleproject.org/monorail/documentation/trunk/advanced/routing.html">proper patch for Castle's website</a>. Gauthier Segay also contributed some sections, and I hope we can now provide some fixed, formal information on Monorail's current routing system. Thank you to Markus Zywitza for applying the patch.</p>
<p>If you see something that looks incorrect, or something that's missing, then you can help <a href="http://using.castleproject.org/display/CASTLE/Helping+With+Documentation">fill in the gaps</a> by patching or just writing it up and someone else will try and create a patch for you.</p>
<p>The next missing docs I plan to address are the <a href="http://using.castleproject.org/display/IoC/Fluent+Registration+API">fluent registration API for Microkernel,</a> but there are a lot of features I'm not 100% on. <a href="http://using.castleproject.org/display/~alwin">Alwin</a> has been doing some great work here so that patch will probably be coming pretty soon. In the meantime, any <a href="http://using.castleproject.org/display/CASTLE/Helping+With+Documentation">contributions</a> would be gratefully received!</p>
