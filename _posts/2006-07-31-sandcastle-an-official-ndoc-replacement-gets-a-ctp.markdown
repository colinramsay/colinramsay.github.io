<p><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/sandcastle1.png">Here's a sample of the output</a>. It's not as nice as NDoc, but it is just a CTP. <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SandcastleMicrosoftCTPOfAHelpCHMFileGeneratorOnTheTailsOfTheDeathOfNDoc.aspx">Scott describes the Sandcastle release in more detail</a>, and mentions the NDoc "controversy" in a sympathetic light:</p>
<blockquote><p>It's a shame that Microsoft can't put together an organization like INETA (who already gives small stipends to folks to speak at User Groups) and gave away grants/stipends to the 20 or so .NET Open Source Projects that TRULY make a difference in measurable ways.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is indeed. Why has Microsoft re-invented the wheel here?</p>
