<p>These are incredible - just fill a datagrid with the results of a database query and you can change attributes to allow pagination, headers on columns for sorting... and dataviews allow filtering and sorting locally. ASP.net is a real shift from what I'm used to but timesavers like these make it worthwhile.</p>
