<p>According to <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/200403.html#d29t1415">Eric Meyer</a> anyway. The way he's putting it, blogs are the opposite of every other way of viewing information. Think about a film - you start in the past but work your way into the present. But on the front page of a blog, the first post represents the present and any further entries take you further into the past. </p>
<p>This could mean that posts you read are out of context, have no background - because that was established at some point in the past. <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/200403.html#d29t1415">Heeeeere's Eric</a>.</p>
