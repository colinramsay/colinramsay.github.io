<p>Visual Studio lets you create project templates, which have certain files and directories already in them when you create a new project. Trouble is, the documentation for this is a little haphazard.</p>
<p>You can find documentation on the objects available to you in the 1033\default.js file <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vsintro7/html/vxlrfprojectobject.asp">in these MSDN pages</a>.</p>
<p>For creating new Project Templates, you can have a look at <a href="http://www.carlosag.net/Articles/createVSTemplate.aspx">this tutorial</a>, which also links to some more MSDN information.</p>
<p>I'd recommend just copying existing Project Templates and then altering them for your nefarious purposes. I'm planning on creating a slightly more advanced Project Wizard soon, so I'll post instructions on that process as well.</p>
