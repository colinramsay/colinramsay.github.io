  content: http://extjs.com/deploy/ext-3.0-rc1/examples/organizer/organizer.html you
    mean? I can't see any Direct code in there, it still looks the same as the old
    Image Organizer. Is it yet to be updated?

<p>The <a href="http://extjs.com/deploy/ext-3.0-rc1/examples/">Ext JS 3.0 examples are online already</a>, and I believe Jack made the announcement at the Ext Convention today. Take a look at this sample showing how to <a href="http://extjs.com/deploy/ext-3.0-rc1/examples/toolbar/toolbars.html">create a Microsoft Word-style ribbon UI with Ext JS 3.0</a>. I really like the <a href="http://extjs.com/deploy/ext-3.0-rc1/examples/button/buttons.html">new button features</a> and the <a href="http://extjs.com/deploy/ext-3.0-rc1/examples/grouptabs/">GroupTabs</a>. I'd expect some more examples on how to use some of the new features like the charting and Ext.direct and I'll try and cover those when they appear.</p>
<p>Update: Cutter points out that there's a new Image Organizer which shows off the Direct functionality but I can only see that in the <a href="http://www.extjs.com/products/extjs/download.php">download</a> at the moment. The examples on the download also cover charting too.</p>
