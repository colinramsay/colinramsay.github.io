<p>D. Keith Robinson did a bit of a redesign recently and <a href="http://www.7nights.com/asterisk/archives05/2005/09/site-tweaks-footer-bad">his search engine rankings suffered</a>. </p>
<p>At Internetware, we have an old-school website with a lot of good content and valuable search engine rankings. Do we redesign for chance human visitors or do we make sure that people can find us in the first place? Because chances are a big redesign (and we've had one ready to go for months) will screw our rankings.</p>
<p>What to do?</p>
