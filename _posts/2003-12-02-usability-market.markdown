<p>What a bloody waste of time <a href="http://zcoburn.f2o.org/index.cfm">this</a> is. It's a blatent popularity contest. I mean, does anyone really believe that Mozdev is the third most usable site on the web?</p>
<p>Congratulations to David Tenser though, it seems that someone's been bigging up Mozilla Firebird Help because it's very prominent on the front page at Usability Market.</p>
<p>Two other things: comments aren't working (might sort it out tonight) and ASP.net is <i>fucking retarded.</i> By default is produces invalid html. I'm going to try overriding the server controls to get them working sensibly, but what the hell was MS thinking of?</p>
