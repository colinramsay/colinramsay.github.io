<p>I've just tracked through a <a href="http://robert.southside.se/2005/04/why-xhtml.html">few articles</a> talking about the <a href="http://www.autisticcuckoo.net/archive.php?id=2005/03/14/xhtml-is-dead">current state</a> of XHTML 1.0. It strikes me that they all rather miss the point of why XHTML is a buzz phrase right now, and it's nothing to do with semantics or XML. It's because of CSS and accessibility.</p>
<p>CSS layouts are huge right now. Most corporate relaunches are CSS based designs. And for some reason, XHTML has got tied up in this revolution.</p>
<p>And one very useful reason for using XHTML that I rarely see - it's consistant. It forces convention. And that's great in a multi-developer environment. Imagine 20 developers coding in C# without some standard to stick to! And imagine the same with a web site. XHTML provides a strict standard for a team to stick to.</p>
