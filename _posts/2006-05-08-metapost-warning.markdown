<p>I haven't written a post about posting for a while, so here we go. I want to revamp this site slightly. I don't want it to be a big hub site, and I don't want to redesign. But I've never been happy with some aspects of the site - particularly the individual post page. I also need a better place to put my projects - javascript and C# stuff which I'm writing for myself and I think that others would be interested in.</p>
<p>I'm going to evolve this site, and I'm going to do it like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve individual post page, and use extended posts more</li>
<li>Better allow for multiple posts in one day by redesigning the main diary slightly</li>
<li>Improve the portfolio section</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not a very grand goal, but that's by design. It means I can achieve it pretty easily.</p>
