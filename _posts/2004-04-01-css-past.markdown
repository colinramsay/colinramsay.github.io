<p>Setting aside all of the excellent technical and ideological reasons for using semantic CSS based designs for websites, I have noticed another reason to celebrate the proliferation of table-less sites. I see fewer and fewer people trying to work around the limitations of CSS in replicating table-based layouts. Instead they are creating innovative CSS-<em>native</em> designs. Rather than forcing their design into a columnar layout or another old-school format, they are opting for designs which fit the tools to hand.</p>
<p>Rather than replicating print based formats, people are finally, finally, adapting to the web. And it's because of CSS.</p>

<p>Keep looking, post examples to the comments. Of course, columns are a great way of layout information, and these designs incorporate them in places. But there's a lot of great ideas sneaking in. <em>Think outside the box</em> (model).</p>
