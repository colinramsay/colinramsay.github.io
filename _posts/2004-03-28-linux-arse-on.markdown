<p>I've spent the day on and off trying to get <a href="http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/" title="Network Simulator">NS</a> to work. It was really a matter of resolving the different dependancies, though one problem was a little obscure - I needed the X Server development package before I could install <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=30174" title="Object TCL">otcl</a>.</p>
<p>Problems resolved, I can now check out the code I have for an assignment due in next week. More importantly, I have an easy way of grabbing screenshots - use <a href="http://www.realvnc.com/">VNC</a> on Windows to connect to an X Session on this (Linux) server. That way I can have Linux on one monitor and Windows on another!</p>
