<p><a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot's</a> transition to an HTML 4.01 / CSS layout went so smoothly that I didn't even notice until I spotted <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/09/22/1324207&from=rss">the story about it</a>. It's amazing to see how a legacy layout such as this can be recreated with CSS, and it's good to see that it's mostly valid. </p>
<p>Standards based web-design is <em>in</em>, and not before time.</p>
