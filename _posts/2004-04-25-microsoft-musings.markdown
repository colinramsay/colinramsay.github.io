<p>There are a number of things going round about Microsoft and their reputation... Just as I post a comment to this <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/04/24.html#a7257" title="Robert Scoble">Scoble post</a>, I notice a few things which connect to it.</p>
<p>Robert says that naming is hard, and of course he's right. There are legions dedicated to choosing the correct brand name for new products. <a href="http://www.johntopley.com" title="John Topley's Weblog">John Topley</a> refers to <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/12/31.html">Scoble's old post</a> on dropping the Windows name in <a href="http://www.johntopley.com/archive/2004/04/21/index.html">his post about people's hatred for MS</a>, because John is speculating on ways to drop the bad rep that Microsoft has. </p>
<p>Windows is a very strong brand name, but I don't know that dropping the brand would solve the problem. As John says, the problem is with Microsoft's reputation. I think that keeping the Windows brand but creating a genuinely good, considerate piece of software will do a lot more for the publicity surrounding the MS OS.</p>
