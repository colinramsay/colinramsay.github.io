<p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/">http://weblogs.asp.net</a> varies in quality quite a bit, but it's worth being subscribed just so you always catch <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/">ScottGu's postings</a>. But recently I've noticed the Visual WebGui blog. This is effectively a product blog - every post since February is a promo for the Visual WebGui tool. Is this what weblogs.asp.net is about? Should posts like this be a regular feature in the content of this community web site? Is it really in the interest of the community at large? <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/astopford/">Andrew Stopford</a> also has a blog there, and while he talks about MbUnit a lot, his posts never feel like they were written by a marketing department. He also speaks on quite a range of subjects, so his blog doesn't leave me with a bad taste in my mouth in the way the Visual WebGui one does.</p>
<p>I guess posters can write whatever they like, but it seems like a waste to turn a good community into an advertising platform.</p>
