<p>Yahoo have updated their excellent pattern and library resource with a couple of interesting things (css reset, hierarchical menus, css fonts), but the one I'm going to mention is CSS Grids. This is a CSS file which, when you give your HTML the correct structure, will give you a robust two column layout. Separated into inner and outer templates, the outer providing the columnar structure and the inner being a grid within the content column of the outer template. <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/grids/example_t2-g6.html">Here's a good example of the CSS Grid idea</a> - the secondary column is a sidebar, and the main content column contains a grid of four other columns.</p>
<p>The strength of this release is that it will be consistant - the CSS will be rock solid. It's a good jump-off point for developers to produce robust layouts, letting them concentrate on the finer points.</p>
