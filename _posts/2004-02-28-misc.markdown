<p>www.stylusmagazine.com has a good interview with Martin Carr. The guy has his head screwed on - he knows that the record companies are on their way out. What else... oh, I downloaded the new Ash single from their site. I paid ?1.50 via my phone (cool method) and got a PIN code. Unfortunately the .WMA file is DRM infected. I have no objection for paying for music, I could have easily got it via P2P programs. But DRM is just bad - I paid for the track, I should be able to do what I want with it....</p>
