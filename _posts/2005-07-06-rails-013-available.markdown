<p>And just in time! I wanted to use the new Ajax effects in a project I've been working on, but not until they were final. <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2005/07/06/rails-013-225-featuresfixes-in-75-days/">That time has come</a>.</p>
<p>Ajax aside, Routes (a stunning feature) have been upgraded to provide a sevenfold speed increase, and the swathe of render_ methods have been consolidated. <a href="http://blog.leetsoft.com/articles/2005/05/26/new-in-rails">Tobias provides an overview of this change</a>.</p>
<p>Conditional validations are new too. The given example is very good; only validate a password for existance if it's a new password... otherwise we can assume it exists.</p>
<p>It's the little things that make me so happy.</p>
