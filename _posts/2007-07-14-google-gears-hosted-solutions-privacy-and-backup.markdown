<p><a href="http://gears.google.com/">Google Gears</a> is an interesting idea which is still in its infancy. I'm interested in the use of offline storage for web apps - you get the benefit of a regularly updated web application with locally stored data - which is interesting in terms of privacy. This could be more beneficial for application developers than for users, since it allows them to provide a central service but give their subscribers the option of  keeping their data to themselves. For financial software, for example, this could be a boon.</p>
<p>Of course this does mean such applications lose a primary benefit of the web app  - that of backup and the ability to roam. Keeping a user's data on their local machine means that they're responsible for their data integrity and for moving their data from machine to machine.</p>
<p>Most applications which use Google Gears won't come up against this problem, because they'll be syncing data back and forth between the local machine and the remote server (<a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/06/06/GoogleGearsReplacingOneProblemWithAnother.aspx">or will they</a>?). But I think there's going to be a new breed of application which relies on the client a little bit more than we've been used to in the past.</p>
