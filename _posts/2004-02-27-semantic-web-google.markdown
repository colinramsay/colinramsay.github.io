<p><a href="http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/21994.htm">This post</a> by a Google employee shows the direction Google is taking. He indicates that semantically correct sites will be given a boosted Google rating. This makes sense - the semantic web is all about <em>meaning</em>, and searching is all about delivering the most appropriate content. </p>
<p>When news of this gets out it could be the killer app for the semantic web.</p>
