<p>Things like Interfaces, Events and Delegates are still a little fuzzy to me. I understand the basic idea, but that's no good when it comes to actually using them. There's a strange little article over at <a href="http://www.developerfusion.co.uk/">Developer Fusion</a> where <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/">Chris Sells</a> develops bog standard code to something a little bit cooler using these ideas. Enjoy <a href="http://www.developerfusion.co.uk/show/4685/">.NET Delegates: A C# Bedtime Story</a>.</p>
