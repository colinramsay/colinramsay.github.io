<p>At the moment, the <a href="http://castleproject.org/">Castle Project</a> is actually host to a number of separate projects. <a href="http://castleproject.org/monorail/index.html">Monorail</a> and <a href="http://castleproject.org/activerecord/index.html">Active Record</a> for example, work extremely well together but Monorail does not require Active Record; the same can be said for <a href="http://castleproject.org/container/index.html">Windsor</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://castleproject.org/castle/download.html">Previous releases</a> of Castle have contained all of the child projects in one package. In future, this may not be the case. The <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/castle-project-users/t/dfa1e5831083d2d5?hl=en">Castle PMC have decided to split each project off</a>, while still keeping them under the Castle banner. This has the immediate advantage than a Windsor release does not have to wait for a Monorail release, which is surely going to increase the mobility of Castle as a whole. While some sections may lag behind for a while, segments are free to move at their own speed.</p>
<p>It's been a while since a full Castle release, and I feel that many developers wait for such releases before adopting a project. More frequent official versions of the Castle components could increase adoption and interest in the overall brand, which can only be a good thing.</p>
