<p>Following my last post, I thought I'd dig around and find out if someone cleverer than me had come up with a way of generating valid XHTML in and ASP.NET page. They had! <a href="http://www.asp.net/Forums/ShowPost.aspx?tabindex=1&PostID=313081">The asp.net forums</a> come to the rescue! I'm going to be migrating Happy And Lost over to XHTML ASAP, and it also means that my Uni project can meet it's target of being valid XHTML. I'm really happy with this discovery, it's something I've been after ever since I got into ASP.NET.</p>
