<p><a href="http://glazkov.com/blog/archive/2005/05/02/476.aspx">Inject tables via javascript</a>? Well it's true to the letter, but certainly not the spirit. Sounds like the last gasp of someone refusing to accept that tables are a dying layout method. CSS design is <em>not the same as table design</em>. It's not just a different way of making the same layouts, it's a totally different way of thinking. Chances are that if you can't do your layout using CSS, you either don't know what you're doing, or your trying to implement something that probably shouldn't be implemented in the first place.</p>
