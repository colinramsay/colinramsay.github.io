<p>I'm just watching the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/showpost.aspx?postid=115387">Microsoft Sparkle movie from Channel 9</a>, and this exchange interested me:</p>
<p>Scoble: "So this lets you build resolution independent UIs?"</p>
<p>Manuel Clement: "Yeah Avalon is resolution independent and DPI independent."</p>
<p>I imagine they'll finally have to re-implement <strong>all</strong> of their interfaces and icons for Vista then?</p>
