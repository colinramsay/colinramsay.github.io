<p><a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">DHH</a> has not only developed a great framework, but he has a fantastic way of phrasing things. From the ongoing Future of Web Apps Summit:</p>
<blockquote><p>Beta is bullshit. Everything is beta. Web apps are never done.</p></blockquote>
<p>Successful web apps are in constant flux. Anyone who expects to get a site developed and to have a runaway success straight off is going to be disappointed. The web needs some <em>loving</em>!</p>
