<p>This YTS article on <a href="http://www.yourtotalsite.com/archives/methodology_tools/the_frontend_architect/Default.aspx">The Front-End Architect</a> was posted while I was ill, so I forgot to mention it.</p>
<p>I totally agree with the sentiment. Working out the layout, the flow and the use cases for the interface of a website is a full time job, and that fact needs to be appreciated by more people.</p>
<p>Even now "architecting" a website system means getting the object model and code correct, when the people who count, the users, will never see whether your code is nice or not. </p>
<p>To ignore the user is to ignore the primary function of your website.</p>
