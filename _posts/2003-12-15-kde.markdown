<p><a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/12/15/1832226&mode=nested&tid=121&tid=185&tid=189">This article</a> made me think about switching to Linux again. <a href="http://www.xfce.org/images/screenshots/default.png" title="XFCE Window Manager">And this</a> Window Manager is supposed to be very lightweight..... And then there's <a href="http://www.ubergeek.tv/article.php?id=27">this</a>, one of the few Windows apps without a Flash alternative - but now available through emulation.</p>
<p>So it could be Linux time once more.... I just like the <strong>idea</strong> of Linux. Even when controlling my server through VNC, it seems much more solid, less likely to break. The way I solved a networking issue with my server by re-writing a Wireless NIC detection script really rocked....</p>
<p>And yet... I still can't play games on it :)</p>
