<p>Everyone's talking about the Blogger relaunch, and rightly so - it's a stunning achievement. However another high profile site has recently been redesigned - <a href="http://www.fileshack.com/ " title="Fileshack">http://www.fileshack.com/</a> - and it's also a full CSS layout. It doesn't validate, which is a bit odd because all the errors are easy to fix. But it's another proof of concept, and that's good.</p>
<p>What I want to see is a really complex e-commerce site in CSS - <a href="http://www.internetware.co.uk" title="Internetware">we're</a> launching some soon, but it's been hard and I don't feel like we're really doing native CSS layouts for them yet. As I said today about one of our sites, "this isn't a CSS layout - it's a table layout redone in CSS". That's a key mistake IMO - CSS should be a new design paradigm as well as a new technology.</p>
