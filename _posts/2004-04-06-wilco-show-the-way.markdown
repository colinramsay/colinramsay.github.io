<p><a href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/news/04-04/05.shtml#story3" title="Pitchfork Media">Pitchfork</a> and <a href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/news/04-04/05.shtml#story3" title="Jeffrey Veen">Veen</a> are both talking about Wilco's interesting method of embracing filesharing. <a href="http://www.justafan.org/" title="Just A Fan">Justafan.org</a> lets you donate to a good cause if you've downloaded a band's album rather than purchasing it. In this way, they are showing that those ''evil filesharers" are just as willing and able to hand over money for the music they love.</p>
