<p>My <a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/diary/category/tickertape/">TickerTape</a> project has turned out to be one of my most popular, turning up in some unexpected places. I do get comments on it now and then, and a few people have mentioned some issues with it which I would like to fix - in particular CPU and memory usage on some browsers. My current plan is to put all material on the TickerTape on <a href="http://code.google.com/">Google Code</a> so that I can track issues, document usage, and accept patches. I will try and do this sometime this month.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The <a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/diary/2009/01/14/javascript-tickertape-on-google-code/">TickerTape is now available on Google Code</a>.</p>
