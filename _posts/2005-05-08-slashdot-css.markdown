<p>Looks like <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> actually <a href="http://slashdot.org/~CmdrTaco/journal/105478" title="Slashdot is going CSS">will be moving to a CSS design</a>. It was <a href="http://slashdot.org/~CmdrTaco/journal/100346">mentioned a while back</a>, and I even looked at the <a href="http://www.slashcode.com/">Slashcode templating engine</a> to try and help out, but it's a nightmare. I'm glad they're finally doing it; I hope that they can roll some sort of HTML compliance in there as well.</p>
