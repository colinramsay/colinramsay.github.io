<p><a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2005/06/25/12312.aspx>Some VS2005 beta testers</a> have picked up on the fact that you can use the VS IDE to give you tabbed browsing for Internet Explorer, after a fashion.</p>
<p>Newsflash kids - try it in VS2003. The exact same thing can be done. In fact, it's even better because you don't get that silly little graphical popup. How long has VS2003 been out? Hmmm.</p>
<p>Double newsflash! Why would you use an IDE to browse webpages? You wouldn't really, would you? In fact you'd use a standalone browser. Like Firefox. Or IE.</p>
<p>But then standalone IE doesn't have tabbed browsing.</p>
