<p>In their infinite wisdom, Microsoft don't let you do a simple install of both browsers side by side. I'm sure there's a very interesting technical reason behind this, but all it really does is make live difficult for developers. Tredosoft came up with a viable alternative when they packaged a couple of hacks together with an IE7 installer to make <a href="http://tredosoft.com/IE7_standalone">IE7 Standalone</a>, and now Microsoft have acknowledge the grief they're giving us. They are offering a time-limited <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/11/30/ie6-and-ie7-running-on-a-single-machine.aspx">Virtual PC image containing XP SP2 with Internet Explorer 6</a>, so that when you upgrade your main machine you can boot this VM to test with.</p>
<p>It's not perfect but it's a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/11/30/ie6-and-ie7-running-on-a-single-machine.aspx">surprising solution</a> from Microsoft and there's no denying it will work well.</p>
