<p><a href="http://adactio.com/journal/display.php/20050421185604.xml">This is a fantastic article</a>, and here's the best line:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pseudo-classes like :focus and :hover are basically event handlers... event handlers with really patchy browser support.</p></blockquote>
<p>I've never though of :hover in that way before, but it is absolutely true. Javascript is an excellent, usable langauge - we can use it to facilitate the experience of the majority user.</p>
