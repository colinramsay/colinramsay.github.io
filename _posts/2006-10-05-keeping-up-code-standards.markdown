<p><a href="http://joel.fjorden.se/static.php?page=CodeStyleEnforcer">Code Style Enforcer</a> is a tool which keeps your coding standards, such as naming conventions, in check. It's useful, because it gives you little popup in Visual Studio when you stray from the conventions, and that's a lot better than having an unused standards document sitting around somewhere. It's like a little coding conscience.</p>
