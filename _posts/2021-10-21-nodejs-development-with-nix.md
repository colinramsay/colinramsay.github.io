title: NodeJS Development Environments with Nix
published: false
---

I use Docker to create development environments for my projects; after too long wrestling with broken setups for Ruby on Rails work, I needed something that could guarantee I could get up and running as quickly as possible. Having migrated my computer to use NixOS, I wanted to see if I could apply my new knowledge to reproducable development environments. I wanted to dabble with NodeGUI, which as the name suggests is for GUI development and that's something I had no experience with using Docker. I figured I might as well try out Nix if I was going to learn something new.
