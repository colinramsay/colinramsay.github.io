<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1847195148/">book</a> which <a href="http://blog.cutterscrossing.com/">Cutter</a>, <a href="http://www.vinylfox.com/">Shea</a> and I wrote is up on the publisher's site for the Author of the Year award. Obviously in our case it'd be co-author of the year but it'd be really nice to be in with a chance. Packt have a <a href="http://authors.packtpub.com/content/packt-author-award-2009">microsite for the award</a> and the <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=J0AzTRKKHU4_2b60_2fGdrouaA_3d_3d">actual poll is here</a>. It's up against some other great books so if you could spare a minute to vote it would certainly be appreciated!</p>
