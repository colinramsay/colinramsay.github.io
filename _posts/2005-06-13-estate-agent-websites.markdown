<p>The majority of estate agents covering my area of the UK have absolutely rubbish frame-infested websites. I was surprised then to see that www.pattinson.co.uk have a <a href="http://www.pattinson.co.uk/Public/Modules/RSS/Default.aspx">customisable RSS feed</a> which will supply you with new properties that match your criteria. <a href="http://www.pattinson.co.uk">Full marks</a>.</p>
