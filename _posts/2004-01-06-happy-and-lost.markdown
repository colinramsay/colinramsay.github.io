<p>I've nearly finished the redesign of <a href="http://www.happyandlost.co.uk" title="Happy And Lost">Happy And Lost</a>, and it's looking pretty good. I've created an administration section in .NET which can be passed the name of a database table and will create forms to edit, delete and add records to that table dynamically. Similarly, there is a generic method of submitting information to the database, I haven't had to create custom forms or routines for anything.</p>
<p>I'm going to develop this a bit further in the near future as it's very handy. Being .NET means I can create a fully OO solution which can be extended with ease. When I do that, we'll have something very cool.</p>
