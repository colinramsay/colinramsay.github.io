<p>I do feel I'm getting the hang of Rails now... a bit. Here's <a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/static/ror/Day%204.html" title="Ruby on Rails - Day 4">the saga of Day 4</a> - the day which really impressed me. The whole layout and template thing was amazing - in ASP.NET terms, it's basically automatic inclusion of templates based on which class and method you're called... except it's not. Very cool, and my controller (the guts of it) is only 21 lines long - and the front end has reached feature parity with the static version!</p>
