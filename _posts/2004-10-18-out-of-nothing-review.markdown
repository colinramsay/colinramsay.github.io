<p><a href="http://happyandlost.co.uk/?mode=features&full=1&id=8">A review of Out Of Nothing by Embrace</a>. I think this is probably the best thing I've ever written, because I really cared about it. It took about a month to do. Even at the end when I was pretty sick of the thing I was still getting people to proof read, and I was even doing something I never usually bother to do - go back and really read what I've written.</p>
<p>Pretty pleased with it, even if there are too many commas, a bit too much enthusiastic talking...</p>
