title: A New Website

A new website! With a new design! And even a more mobile-friendly template! Does this mean I'll post more! Probably not!

I've been wanting to move to Github Pages for a while, but I was worried about breaking incoming links. I finally decided that I didn't really care that much and did a SQL dump of my old Wordpress site which I pushed through the Jekyll importer. It all seems to work a treat, and now the whole setup is in git, which makes me feel like it's a lot more robust but with fewer moving parts.

Here's to another ten years of blogging anyway!
