<p>Is it just me, or has Google changed something? </p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=test&btnG=Google+Search&meta=">Here, do a search.</a></p>
<p>For me, I get yellow text to highlight what I searched for (Searched the web for "test") and a link that says "[new window]" on a lot of links. Weird. Have these always been here?</p>
